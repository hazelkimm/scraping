I, for one, genuinely believe this game is a ground breaking game that beautifully combined shooter gameplay with a role playing storyline and it's also the best game Bioware offered so far after Baldur's Gate series. The most problems people complained at are actually what makes mass effect 2 truly shine. I understand die hard RPG fans are very hard to please, but the game has to evolve to get better. Mass Effect 2 did it and did it brilliantly. First, the removal of redundant inventory makes mass effect 2 a very well paced game. One of major bad design in mass effect is its painful inventory system. so you are a distinguish soldier and a spectre and you still have to kill mobs to loot better weapons and armors or sell those stuff for credits? why the council does not supply the best gears and funds to you? Also, dont you feel weird that a human being can carry dozens of guns and armors with him. Mass Effect 2 did it right, shepard can only carry several guns on mission and every weapon you start with is still viable in later game, also you get funds directly from Cerberus. Those changes are made for better experience. One thing I do miss is the weapon mods. they could do it like deus ex that gives a small and limited space to store some extra stuff.  Second, character development is still a huge part of gameplay and the skills and abilities are still necessary for combat and social especially when mass effect 2's shooting mechanics is actually not that great. Some people think that role-playing means running around for meaningless side quests (mass effect 1 comes to mind) and keeping track of stats. I would those are not what defines role playing game. Mass Effect 2 gives the player the true immersion that you can expect from a role playing story line.

With that said; I find there are two flaws in this game. First, the number of comrades you pick up in the game is to large. Now, you might ask why this could possibly be a problem. This is quite simple, all of them have a \"loyalty quest\" - and with so many comrades all the sidequests feel a disconnected to the main plot. Add to this that with so many comrades, you never get a special feeling for any of the comrades - like you did in the first mass effect where you had a more limited number of them. Its a shame really.', 'The second flaw, is the whole weapon system. This problem is more compounded by several smaller issues. First off is the \"new and improved\" ammo system, which blows to be honest. The first game had a heatcooldown system, which was actually fine. Now you have what they call \"heat clips\" that are universal, yet you cant shift them between the your weapons - this is just plain odd. besides the weapon selection is dumbed down to much. You have a severely limited amount of weapontypes to choose from, and the way you upgrade and find them feel.... well to be honest, mildly retarded.

Since ME2 was a very anticipated release, I think Bioware tried to make it a more crowd pleasing game. ME2 thrives in it's combat elements, graphics, and plot, but lags in being an RPG. Leveling up was toned down, along with various other elements.

People thought the controls and fighting mechanics were better?  Here's what I've come to realize.  Mass Effect was a great RPG, with some action/3PS (3rd person shooter?) elements mixed in.  Mass Effect 2, was an action game at heart, with some pretty shoddy RPG elements.  Gone are the multiple tiers and classes of armor, with corresponding types and tiers of upgrades.  Gone is any tactical setup of your squad for combat.  Just spam all of the abilities you can at the enemy.  Gone is a much more detailed and better implemented leveling point system.  And gone is planetary exploring, which I think would have been cooler if they fleshed it out instead of getting rid of it entirely.  People say the combat in ME2 was better.  Not to me.  I read all the codex.  What they had implemented in 1 made sense with the lore.  Didn't like overheating?  Too bad, get a *better weapon* or *better upgrades*.  Jesus it's called customizability.  That's what an RPG is all about.  There were some *really* cool things they implemented in 2, however.  So here is the good part of the review.  Just the plain fact that you could actually continue a character on from 1 was amazing to me.  However, I thought ME2's characters were better than 1's anyway, so I'm glad you got to work with an almost entirely new cast.  (Although they kept my favorite Quarian :D.)  Planet scanning was also way better than that side quest to find minerals from ME1, and I appreciated that you could actually integrate resources you find into your ship and customizing your character.  Although once again, I would appreciate more options.  Finally, there were things I thought were better and worse about the story.  I really liked the loyalty missions, but I think it would have been better to have a central questline instead of making the loyalty missions the central component of the game.  The problem here was that the story lacked focus, as there was literally no plot up until the end when you finally did the suicide mission (which was awesome!!!)  ME1, by comparison, had an extremely focused central questline, but lacked in detailing the side characters perhaps a little bit more.  So that's pretty much it for this review.  Overall, I think what really got to me was that they took what was supposed to be an RPG series and kinda did away with all that.  I didn't appreciate that very much.  But since I am all about story, I will say that Mass Effect continues to have a strong story and character design, just perhaps not at the same time.  I am still looking forward to ME3.\"]\n",

It has much improved combat, the voice and digital acting is great and the attention to character development is much appreciated.

However, while at first it seems really good, the shooting becomes a bit monotonous later on (cover, shoot, cover, shoot. I know shooting is always like that but still....). In addition, you have to gain necessary upgrades by scanning which is just sheer boredom and the game seems like such a chore at times to do side-missions for no particular reason and if you don't do them then that character of your team dies. Nowhere near a bad game, it's very enjoyable in parts, just not as great as I was expecting.\"]\n",

It's The Secret of Monkey Island. I cannot give this the full 10 out of 10 because it is a remake  relaunch of a classic, but there has been taken a lot of good effort to make it work on the newer gaming systems.

It may be a pretty obvious cash-in, but it's been done with lots of care about the game and consideration of both old and new fans. So yes, take my money, again, for the same game.

This expansion pack includes a new faction to play as and a ton of general improvements on what made vanilla SupCom such a unique experience. Forged Alliance really pulls off what it attempts to do. It is face-paced by nature but games can last well over an hour. Economy plays a massive role and players have the option of bunkering down in their starting location or can simply pour all their resources into spamming cheap units. There's also the option of sniping; selecting a group of units, quite often bombers or gunships, and assassinating an opponent's ACU. There really are more strategic options than any other RTS I have ever played. The FAF multiplayer community makes this a 10/10 experience and has really kept the game alive. SupCom 2 simplified the formula and was generally panned by the fan base so it's great to see FA doing so well today. A classic game.\"]\n",

The UI improvements are the biggest change to me, and nothing could help more in a heated online game fight to control your forces. If you are a single-player gamer, id say definatly pass on this expansion. The AI has some issues where it takes up vast vast amounts of your system resources, and since I wont get into my systems specs here i'll just say I built my own super-system for $6000 in December '07. SupCom FA bogs down horribly in single play on any system, where as the original SupCom does not. Seems like some internal software issue they havent worked out yet, according to the forums and my personal programming experience. Multi-player is awesome, and the new units are a whole lot of fun, not to mention a lot of the new balance changes to keep players from spamming lots of engineers to end a large map game. However, if you are running a high-end system like me, you will be disappointed with this game in another way. The graphics have been toned down a lot, and the game no longer supports DX10. Might not seem like a big deal, but after viewing the comparison screen shots & FRAPS videos first hand, on max settings it doesnt hold up to the original SupCom. Check the web, there are some comparison shots. Understandably, it was toned down to match the average game player. Was a bit silly to cater towards a small percentage of the market with higher-end systems. For a single-player gamer, and/or someone with a high-end PC looking for good graphics, id reccomend the original SupCom. The new software makes it is playable, but not very enjoyable. 5/10 for them. For the multi-player strategist, id definatly reccomend it (no-AI players or you'll shoot yourself in the foot online!), because its the best thing since sliced bread, 10/10 for them.\"]\n",

Mass fabricators are nerfed and mass extractors are now the primary source of mass, thus expansion and aggression is the only way to victory. Superweapons, with the exception of game ending artillery, are all cheaper and easier to produce, introducing a previously missing strategic option.

FA is to Homeworld 2 as Supreme commander is to the original Homeworld, in that you will spend most of your game time repelling invasions and rebuilding, and not actually playing the bloody game. Only until you build experimentals do you actually stand a chance at pushing forward... and at this point, the campaign missions are over in a hurry. Speaking of experimentals, there is not one mission where you don\\'t fight an experimental, or have to repel an experimentals early in the game. Resource management is just as stupid to manage in FA as it was in SupCom; however, it is even more so in FA as the enemy loves to rush, and without adequate resources in the first place, you will be unable to defend yourself. Being able to choose a campaign and go through that faction\\'s unique story and struggle has disappeared in favor of a single, similar story (and missions for all three factions) with the option to be different factions during said mission. The only difference in these missions might be one objective. The Dev\\'s have unlocked the tech tree for you (no progressing as you complete the campaign anymore) and have given free rein on how the player approaches the mission. But given the amount of rushing that the A.I. does, the only choice is to spam units of your own, turtle, or build experimentals. Tactics have gone the way of the Dodo, and brute force has taken it\\'s place. In regards to the story, it\\'s worse than the original. Unlike the original, battle plans on how to defeat the enemy are not discussed; it\\'s just \"go here, turtle up, steamroll the enemy, and gate off planet\". Other story elements are weak and predictable and don\\'t convey much of a story, let alone a unique FA universe. Just \"oh no! we\\'re losing! hold the line!\" like many other sci-fi stories that have come before FA. The A.I. is horrible, often targeting the same three defenses over and over again. Often, it will take 20 failed raids before the A.I. realizes the strategy isn\\'t working, and will spam new units against another section of defenses until it slowly realizes once again that said strategy isn\\'t working. Because the A.I. is too stupid to target wall sections, all one has to do is build a wall surrounding your base and laugh as they sit there like hungry puppies at a door. Once tech 2 turrets are up, you can snipe said puppies. And don\\'t get me started on performance. The damn game requires modifications to run properly on multi-core systems; otherwise you get massive slow down. Modifications help to alleviate this problem and turn an average game into a good one; however, i must judge the game on what the Dev\\'s did, and not what modders can do.']\n",

            "Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance [\"This is a significant upgrade to the SupCom engine, making everything appear much more polished and smoother, especially with fog of war. Along with balance changes and new units, it's like a whole new game, rather than an expansion. My favorite part of this game is how it offers a mesmerising view of a futuristic battlefield. How it allows you to zoom up, watch individual parts of an unit move and fire true projectiles. That might not seem to be not that special, but the level of amusement I get when I see projectiles hit things they're not supposed to hit is goofy high. I can spend hours zoomed in just to watch the animations of units, even small things like energy storage growing taller as more energy is stored, and how engineers tilt their wheels to float on the water. I wish every game had strategic zoom like this game, with such polished visuals.\\r\", ' ', \"The user interface is still rather basic, but much improved over the original, giving you much more space to see the battlefield. It requires 3rd party add-ons (UI mods) to allow things such as keybind remapping, to display health bars all the time, managing templates easier, and upgrade helpers. I highly recommend at least getting GAZ_UI (I used version 6.1). I had to adjust my build order with the changes that took place, such as starting with a factory first. It wasn't until FA that I seriously started to look at deciphering all the + and - numbers on everything, and learning how to balance energy income with mass income, depending on what I wanted to build. A lot of reading tooltips, looking at unit stats in the unit database web page, and a bit of math helped me out, which is akin to doing spreadsheets.\\r\", ' ', 'This game seems to love Intel processors, or those with great \"single-thread\" performance. Playing on a laptop or AMD CPU will result in some slow-mo action before the end. Even if you have a good CPU, playing in a game with another with a slow CPU can make it agonizingly slow for you, especially if you\\'re used to it being faster. The game doesn\\'t run smoothly at full speed if there\\'s someone else in your game with a poor or unreliable connection as well. I felt like I couldn\\'t play big 8 player games with air battles and 1000 unit cap, until I got my PC upgraded (from AMD X3 720 to i2600k).\\r', ' ', 'The gameplay itself is a handful. It\\'s a challenge to multi-task. The objective is simple, to destroy the enemy commander, but achieving it is another story. You should manage to progress your economy, never settling with a certain amount as \"enough\", and considering how there\\'s 3 tech levels of it and the hugeness of how maps are, you quickly find out how difficult it is to keep track of anything spread out. Staying compact will allow you to progress through tech at a manageable pace, but this is not an ideal way to achieve victory. Until you get used to things, to the point they become subconscious actions, your strategies will be extremely limited. I resorted to gambling with basic strategies, such as building up dozens of tanks, outnumbering the enemy, and using an upgraded commander to spearhead the assault, looking to surround the enemy commander. At first it was successful, but as maps get bigger and enemy teams get more members, this becomes less effective. Using a dozen tech 2 bombers or gunships to just simply fly in and bomb the enemy commander was a gamble that was easily countered by a shield and a few flak units. Once I got the hang of quickly upgrade my mass, I tried getting out an experimental as quickly as possible, but this strat could be beaten by a zerg rush. Sneaking a T3 commander with a transport as soon as possible was a huge gamble, but seemingly was the only strat that worked if I could land it where I wanted, without endless practice in other parts of the game.\\r', ' ', 'Multiplayer is still barely alive. I was able to register my product serial on Steam to play there, but a competing 3rd party lobby seems to be sucking players away with its advertising. If you choose to play multiplayer on that other lobby, \"FAF\", I hope you have thick skin and have great luck! I\\'d describe it as being an active volcano. Be extra cautious and watch out for eruptions. Go in with low expectations, else you may be disappointed, as their advertisements are clearly biased. They lose as many users as they get new ones, due to how toxic and unwelcoming they can be to some, especially those who go in expecting too much. Stick it out and endure the frustration and you\\'ll be able to play one of the most noteworthy RTS games with some actual players.\\r', ' ', \"After playing this, I haven't found another RTS that has impressed me enough. SupCom2 was okay for a short while, fixing some issues I had with Forged Alliance, but was not close to being a FA killer, since it just didn't have the same scale and felt cheapened overall, such as with the cheesy sound effects (ex. commander explosion) and Aeon unit names that sounded cheap and unoriginal.

            "Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance ['The game is great, but there are so many issues that ruin it in many ways. First of all, if you have units attacking, they will not move if there\\'s an obstacle in their way and will attack hills, walls, etc. This results in the pointless and frustrating loss of units. Second, The fog of war effect is sort of poor in some regards. For an example, one of my enemies sent a Galactic Colossus at me, and started shooting my commander. I had no clue what it was because its laser beam not show up on the screen (it just looked like my commander was dying randomly). Another very annoying thing is the fact that missiles cannot be destroyed with tactical missile defense systems, unless they\\'re \"tactical\" missiles. The amount of times I\\'ve had the AI turtle in their base spamming air transports, missile launchers, and turrets is insane. I swear, the only air vehicles they ever make are air transports. Lastly, your AI \"allies\" screw you over all the time. I have had them send engineers straight off the bat to take all my extracting points and hydrocarbon plants. They also love spamming engineers, Tech 1 tanks, etc in your base. When the AI puts their units on your factories, they stop producing units. Just imagine it. You\\'re defending your base from a spam of armed air transports, missile launchers, and Tech 1 assault bots. After you kill them, you notice two of your mass extractors were destroyed, and replaced with a Tech 3 mass extractor your ally put there with that engineer that\\'s blocking your factory production, causing you to lose buildings and units. Of course, you can reclaim their units, but it takes forever to reclaim their Tech 3 extractors. Most of the time I get carried away and forget I sent an engineer to destroy the mass extractor they stole, and then come back later to see them rebuilding it. In general, this game is wonderful, but these are crippling issues.']\n",

            "Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance ['4 / 10 is a fair rating for a game where you get a barebones strategy game with broken features, dumb units, buggy pathfinding and a braindead AI in a boring campaign.\\r', 'The game has so many issues that it goes beyond the character limit when I tried to write them all down, even when trying to keep it as short as possible.\\r', 'Major issues with the game:\\r', \"Population: Each unit and structure costs 1 population of your population limit. This means the larger your base the fewer units you're able to build. There's no way to increase this without messing with the game itself. This also means that a high tech experimental unit, that can easily kill hundreds of tech 1 units, costs just 1 population, like each of the hundreds of attacking tech 1 units does.\\r\", \"Veterancy: The veterancy system is kill based. This punishes you for sending cheap, fast produced units that die easily towards the enemy. The game likes to show off with it's mass battles but that's entirely deceiving when realizing how the population and veterancy systems work. Only a fool would play that way.\\r\", \"Bugs: Pathfinding, audio, late game performance are the most important of many. The pathfinding bug will regularly cause one or more of your units to get stuck, even if there's nothing to get stuck on. It just happens. The audio issue seems to be entirely random, going from functional to nonfunctional, to functional again, with cause and fix yet to be determined. For all of those that had it it somehow magically fixed itself later on even though literally everything possible on their system and with the game (uncluding formatting, reinstall of Windows + the game) was tried to no avail. It just worked again at some point without any change of hard- or software. There are 2 types of the audio bug: #1 crashes your game after a few minutes in or may cause severe but short slowdowns, #2 just causes mission briefings to not load, in-mission dialogues to be without sound and unit-selection response sounds only playing once and then never again while all weapon sounds still work flawlessly and can happen while playing. The late game performance bug is due to memory leaks that never remove defeated AIs and units, causing the game to slow down massively the longer it runs and to eventually crash.\\r\", \"AI: It does not exist. It needs to be told what it's supposed to do, even what to build. It doesn't really react to anything happening. It's not fit for survival, as it even lacks a concept to protect and hide it's ACU, the core unit that it needs to protect as otherwise it loses the game once it's destroyed. The AI is a wild mix of all vision omnipresence cheating, knowing your weak spots without ever scouting properly, and some really stupid easily disposed of joke.\\r\", \"Futuristic: I expected this game to be about futuristic combat but this was also entirely deceiving as most units only have a single type of weapon and there are literally no intersting, clever weapon systems at work in the entire game. Everything is just pretty looking but totally dumbed down. In fact the UI isn't even build to support the usage of special unit abilities, like it's the case in other games and thus most units only have an off/on toggle for some energy draining abilities, like radar. Again it's just pew pew lazers and shields with a few hover units what's understood as futuristic combat.\\r\", \"Combat: The game lacks a concept to make certain units better vs specific targets they're meant to counter while weaker vs specific targets they're meant to be countered by entirely. This means a sniper bot deals the same damage vs a base building engineer as vs a tank, any structure, a battleship, shield etc. This turns the game away from actual strategy gameplay to unit values of production speed, production price (mass, energy), weapon range, DPS, damage per salvo and maybe whether it's single target damage or area damage that matter. But that you have a tank there that's supposed to be tanky isn't a concept the game grasps. Low tech units just get useless later on, which limits the actual amount of units that you can play with to a bit more than a hand full per faction plus their faction-specific experimentals.\\r\", \"Also despite being largely about construction there's no helpful construction grid and things can't be managed properly because of a lack of command options as well as UI features. If you're really unlucky an engineer that's ordered to construct on uneven ground will elevate all to the same height level when beginning to construct and thus ruin the entire build space around that area that's then no longer usable for construction by you. But I was told in the forums that this is not an issue because it happens only rarely, even if it mattered to me back then. It's fine... Uninstall and into the trash it goes. There's just much more that's unfun than fun inside. One of the most deceiving titles I've ever had to deal with. Absence of strategy, lack of gameplay. See youtube.\"]\n",

My criticisms about this game are agitated by the fact that Relic keeps releasing more and more races into the online mix, (Nine total with the next expansion), and its become just silly. You cannot take this game seriously anymore, and while it's cartoonistic humour and style used to suit it well. It's become to the point where Relic dirtied the bath water with a bunch of filthy pointless races that don't complement the others at all.

When it was the first game, vehicles like the dreadnought were immensely powerful and exciting to watch as they threw around squads and ripped through them. With every 'balance' patch relic has released, their sole idea was to NERF other units down to balance the gameplay instead of bump the other units up.

I find that the excitement and the fast-paced gameplay is no-more because of Relic's constant balance nerfs. Secondly, the end result of having NINE races into the Warhammer mix is that this game is now IMPOSSIBLE to properly balance. And any attempt by Relic's traditional nerfing will simply cause slower and slower-paced fighting. I am positive that this game's future is dead. My four is given to this game mainly because of the way it's been handled over the years. It's just been terribly poor and the original depth to it has been filled in with poor design. The original pace and character of the series is utterly gone with the arrival of these new expansions. It seems like they just churn out their ideas constantly. And some of these ideas are just disturbing, they have three races revolving around Death, one based on Feminists, another two on technology worship, and the last on religious fanaticism. The Orks main theme is stupidity, seriously, the developers spell everything wrong in the Ork descriptions. ??? In conclusion, this game used to be really something, but Relic's deadening patches and un-inspired expansions have proven to be more like a cancer.

Secondly, the end result of having NINE races into the Warhammer mix is that this game is now IMPOSSIBLE to properly balance. And any attempt by Relic's traditional nerfing will simply cause slower and slower-paced battles. I am positive that this game's future is dead. My four is given to this game mainly because of the way it's been handled over the years. It's just been terribly poor and the original depth to it has been filled in with short-sighted design. The original pace and character of the series is utterly gone with the arrival of these new expansions. It seems like they just churn out their ideas constantly. And some of these ideas are just disturbing, they have three races revolving around Death, one based on Feminists, another two on technology worship, and the last on religious fanaticism. The Orks main theme is stupidity, seriously, the developers spell everything wrong in the Ork descriptions. ??? In conclusion, this game used to be really something, but Relic's deadening patches and un-inspired expansions have proven to be more like a cancer. There is not a chance they can ever straighten out this gameplay as far as I can see, and the game is just no longer fun. It's just silly.\"]\n",

This made me realize you probably have never rolled a dice nor played the tabletop game of this wonderful game. There are in fact more races than nine in the tabletop form of the game, and the \"balance\" is made by making each individual really good at something, but lacking in something else. For example, Eldar had tons of specialist troops that were really good at what they do (Dire Avengers absolutely pouring out shots like it was nothing),but were extremely fragile and somewhat expensive as far as points. If there were a universal \"balance\" of power, then I agree, gameplay would become pretty boring as the races seem to be intertwined. That\\'s why the developers at the former company of THQ added more races with different attributes, which can clearly be seen in the Tau\\'s overall godliness at shooting, the space marines being expensive but good at everything, the Eldar\\'s speed, the Necron\\'s toughness, and the imperial guard and ork\\'s strength in numbers. Your criticism of the themes that the people at THQ had for their races also rings hollow when you dig into some of the tabletop game\\'s lore. Orks are meant to be stupid, they\\'re fungi made into a humanoid form. Necrons and Tau basically worship technology  but their lore says why. Necrons made a pact with a god who appears as a metallic figure to immortalize their race as they were facing extinction, but the god turned them into soulless machines  to do his bidding to pretty much annihilate anything. The Tau worship technology because they were deprived of it. Think of going to a third world country with an iphone, or even better think of Hernan Cortez being worshipped as a god by the Incas for his appearances, ships, and horses. I\\'m assuming the death theme has to do with the Chaos faction. That should really be a no brainer, there has to be a villainous character, so why not  exemplify it into an entire race who, in the lore, attempted to kill the Imperial Guard\\'s/Space Marine\\'s god? Feminist\\'s? The only feministic race I could think of in Dark Crusade would be Eldar, and yeah that\\'s just because the founders of the table top game just made like that to fit their attributes of sneakiness and deception. So really, all your problems with the dev\\'s as far as themes are honestly unfounded because they took most of the content from the tabletop game.

            "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas [\"For me, GTA games are about driving, vehicle variety, weapon variety, mission variety, and exploration. In other words, I play these games for the gameplay. That being said, I find San Andreas to be the greatest GTA game of all time. The driving is probably the most important aspect of a GTA game. It's what you're going to be doing most of the game. Yes, you can walk on foot, but most of the time missions require you to drive to your destination, and it's not always just a mile or so away. And even once you arrive at your destination, half the time the mission is going to require that you drive anyway. So if the driving doesn't work well in a GTA game... Well what does? There goes a massive portion of the game down the toilet. But like I said, this isn't the case for San Andreas. It has the best vehicle variety we've seen in a GTA game so far - Cars, airplanes, motorcycles, motorbike, bicycles, helicopters, boats, jetpacks, tanks, etc. each of which having their own advantages in differing situations. For example, a bike is slower in general, but you are able to bunny hop when you're on the bike so it is good for hopping over fences to get away from cops. Motorcycles have a very high acceleration (short term speed), and a decent top speed, but you won't have the defense that a car provides. I could sit here and explain each vehicle type in detail but it would be useless - Bottom line, the vehicles are widely varied in this game. Now as for the actual driving mechanics, this game went for the unrealistic, fast paced style GTA game. GTA IV went with a slower, more realistic style. Well, I mean I'm playing a video game. I don't expect it to be realistic. That adds nothing to the game for me, but the change between the driving mechanics in San Andreas and GTA IV did in fact slow the gameplay down severely. It only did negative. I don't think they're going to go back to the old, unrealistic but fun style of GTA games. San Andreas is probably the last good GTA game. Also, the difficulty level of this game was amazing (referring to the missions). It is without a doubt the hardest GTA game, and although there are a few silly, problematic missions where things are hard for reasons obviously unintended by Rockstar, these very few negatives are severely overshadowed by the massive amount of positives. So let me sum it up - It provides the best challenge, it has the best mechanics in a GTA game, and it has the most variety. What more could you ask for?\"]\n",

            "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas [' This is a great game. I have the ps2 version, but I got the pc version so I could see it on a monitor. There is a MUCH greater draw distance and the textures are sharper. It\\'s great fun to just go driving and see hills in the distance, even condos on the hills! It can be breathtaking at times. You really feel like you\\'re driving around a real city; there\\'s a range and diversity to the terrain that you just don\\'t get from imagined environments. The only negative point is the scripting and AI. This was a problem I didn\\'t notice on the PS2, but on the PC, they stumble around like clowns. Cops in cars will make u-turns, fail to turn tightly enough, and kill other cops by squashing them against a wall. (I picked up a free baton and a gun this way!) Other drivers will sometimes bizarrely turn off a straight road for no apparent reason and smash into a wall. I saw one guy drive over a dock - his car plunged into the water, and he died. The people will walk into each other and get stuck, hilariously calling each other \"fool\" while they mill around unable to get out of each other\\'s way (This happened with the gangs). It\\'s a shame..graphically, you really feel like you\\'re exploring San Andreas but when things like that happen suddenly it\\'s just a game again. Also character models are repeated WAAAAAY too often. You can often see as many as five identical clones within viewing distance - five short skirted hookers, or half naked strutting men, or whatever. Once again it detracts from the experience reminding you it\\'s just a game. But overall these were minor flaws, in the main, it\\'s a great experience, I even had my GF watching over my shoulder because she wanted to see what the US looked like ....she was a little shocked by the language. :-)']\n",

            "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas [\" The missions are too similar to previous GTA games, i.e. drive from A to B, kill someone and drive back to A. Or kill someone and drive back to A while some people chase you. Or while the cops chase you. Or before time runs out. The side missions are the same. Whether it's collecting secret packages, spraying 'tags', taking photos or collecting horse-shoes, IT'S ALL THE SAME. Delivering pizzas, passengers, prostitutes or couriering, IT'S ALL THE SAME. Sure, it's fun but no where near as fun as it was the first time you did it in GTA 3 or Vice City. Probably the only differing missions are the flying missions and there's not much variety there, either. For such an open-ended game, the missions are so unimaginative, repetitive, and SHORT. The theme of L.A. street gangs is the worst yet. That's partly because the scope of your typical street gang is too small and offers no real possibly for character development/evolution. And partly because you sense it's aimed at satisfying those who go puppy-eyed when they see Tupac on TV and who romanticise petty crime. With such a theme, the music is predictably the worst of any 3D GTA game. The sheer size of the game world is impressive at first, but not when you realise that so much of it is dead space and offers severely limited interactivity. I'd prefer a world the size of Vice-city with maximum interactivity than a larger world with great pockets of useless space. The graphics are poor. The inclusion of girlfriends is totally pathetic and surely can't interest anyone over the age of 13. I'm a millionaire who takes an unattractive girl to a fastfood restaurant for dinner? What the hell is that? A relationship? There are some neat improvements such as customising cars and a pay'n'spray that eliminates any wanted level, not just the first two wanted levels. Driving schools and flying schools are great optional activities in which to hone skills. There's so much more to say but, in short, Rockstar have to re-conceive of GTA, re-plan missions (don't make them so straight-forward and short) and get rid of all the cutesy-poo girlfriend nonsense and disco dancing. Vice City was captured so perfectly. There is so much to lampoon both in and out of popular culture when it comes to L.A. streetgangs, yet Rockstar panders to it instead of treating it as it treated Vice City. Since GTA is so popular in Japan, it would great if the next GTA was set there because it so nicely opens up the possibility of again humourously reflecting upon popular culture while unleashing total carnage. Oh yeah, bring back the RAMPAGES! The best repetitive side-missions!\"]\n",

This game, an open-world third person shooter, is very well-written and funny as hell (I could spend hours listening to the in-car radio listening to the great music and the hilarious advertisements.) The only thing keeping this game from a 10 from me is the graphics. As I have stated in a few of a previous reviews, I am not one to grade down on graphics. However, this game came out in 2005 for the PC, and graphics for this time were becoming more advanced, yet Rockstar did not update or upgrade their engine from the previous GTA3 release. However, this game's shooting and hand-to-hand combat mechanics are very well done for a third person shooter. In many other third person shooters, I often struggle with aiming and lining up shots. In San Andreas, however, the zoom makes it easier, and lining up a shot much less difficult. The part I liked the most, aside from the story line, was the RPG elements it offered. It is an ambitious system, for a game of its era, in my opinion. It allows customization of the character, CJ, in many different ways, such as clothing, muscle, fat, and weapon skills are upgraded as they are used. The game takes into account these things for how the game progresses. To conclude this, GTA: San Andreas is a very well-written, and story-driven game. Though the graphics are dated, it still makes for a great game that can be played for hours on end, and when its been played already, it still has a whole lot of replay value, to explore more, to choose a different path.\"]\n",

I\\'m not complaining about graphics being improved or anything for the PC, but Rockstar always gets lazy when it comes to PC ports. Look at GTA IV for example. The in-game settings don\\'t stay the same every time you launch the game. You have to disable/enable the \"Frame Limiter\" option just to get certain game elements to work - and things like that usually make me quit playing a game outright and forever, but this game redeems that with the tons of positives. Apart from the PC issues, you\\'re gonna come across those moments where a mission is insanely too hard or the AI doesn\\'t work the way it should and it screws you in the end somehow. These are the same things you encounter in the previous games like Vice City and GTA III. Do these things break the game entirely? Not really. But can these things frustrate you greatly? Yes, very much so. Overall, if you\\'re an old time gamer or a person just becoming a gamer, play this game. Just do it. Oh, and guess what? This game has two multiplayer mods known as San Andreas Multiplayer and Multi Theft Auto where up to 100 players can play on the same world. Be sure to play that too. Yes, both of those multiplayers are still being played.']\n",

When it first came out reviewers more or less panned it because of its bugs which made it unplayable for many.  I personally never experienced any bugs that destroyed my gameplay experience, but no doubt, it had a few glitches that forced me to save frequently to be on the safe side and be a little patient with it, like a wild animal - wondrous but unpredictable.  That said, there are many free user-created patches which solve this problem, easy to install and find.  I found them almost ten years ago, well-before I started using mods.', 'But why bother with Bloodlines if there are other newer games with professional support?  Well, there is still no game out there that captures horror cyberpunk in video gaming so well. It matches Deus Ex for crafty grit and conspiracy.  It horrifies while pulling you in.  Several stories play with zombie survival, even subtly introducing a George Romero-style character.  Other stories feel more like the movie Session 9.  Most stories, though, put you in the shoes of a capable investigator who\\'s in way over his head - think Blade Runner, with less cyborg and more vampire.  You rifle through drawers, question strange personalities, occasionally run for your life, sneak down hallways, fight notorious killers, meet a variety of damsels in distress which put Witcher to shame, and maneuver between gritty Chinatown Tong.

Bloodlines immerses, if nothing else.  But what about the gameplay ask modern players?', \"It's well-conceived but nothing spectacular.  It will feel much like Deus Ex yet again, but with the graphics those fans wished for.  True, by today's standards of fps, Bloodlines doesn't amaze.  There are relatively few gun choices, relatively simple combat effects, and you don't get a ton of fancy moves or smooth-as-butter controls.  What it gives up in combat play it makes up for in choices and character build: just like its runner up in rpgs, Deus Ex.  Comparisons here are unavoidable since the controls can seem a little clunky compared to modern games, but the variety of choices balances this.  Few games offer such variety in character building though, except for maybe Fallout 3.  And few games emphasize those skills as well through multiple routes to solve almost any confrontation.  One might sneak past guards, persuade them to allow you to pass, seduce them with a wink, intimidate with the help of some vampire glamour, find a back entrance and pick the lock, go in guns blazing, or even charge in with a katana like Musashi himself.  There really, really, is no game out there that rewards attention to character creation like this.  Between the quest options, the clan choices in character creation, the character build choices, and your influence on factions, possibilities are endless.  It is literally the only rpg or fps Iâ\"]\n",

Also, you choose at the beginning which bloodline (faction) you are part of, which will directly affect your relationships with the characters in-game, offering variation and replayablility, if you don't mind already knowing the storyline the second time through. Finally, the level design is very well done, giving varied and interesting locations that will keep your interest, no rampant cookie-cutter design here.\", \"On the down side, it is a dated game, having been released in 2004, so you will probably only get the most out of it if you don't mind the avatars looking a bit blocky compared to what you might be used to. I'm sure it was 'fairly' close to cutting edge graphics in 2004, but if you can look past it, the game will suck you in and you won't notice.\", \"It was mentioned that the game doesn't feel finished by one reviewer, and while I disagree, I can see why that might come up.

I'd used the official patch when I played it, and didn't come across any problems. I certainly didn't come close to checking on forums, as one or two others had, but everyone plays a game differently, and it's becoming standard practice to check forums rather than think a problem through, or work around it. Regardless, apparently the unofficial patch made by fans is the best, from what I gather.\", \"Overall I greatly enjoyed the game and thought it to be underrated, definately a pleasant surprise. At no point did I get bored, even though there are many areas, nor did I question whether I'd see it through to the end, unlike quite a few games which get churned out. The storyline was interesting, and I found myself carefully watching the behaviour of all the characters, not quite sure who to trust, as it should be in a vampire underworld. The hotel level was especially spooky, I might add ;) good job on that. I only wish that there was a sequel.\"]\n",

It\\'s full of unique characters as interesting and fully developed as any you\\'d find in an RPG from Bethesda or Bioware---if not more so! The game also goes above and beyond the RPG call of duty by rising above mere fetch quests and combat, sending you on a variety of interesting missions. Don\\'t be surprised to find yourself playing action one minute, mystery the next, and horror the next.

When you find yourself sitting at your desk in your safehouse, checking your email on your computer while laughing at the hysterical \"frickin\\' chicken\" commercial on the radio for the hundredth time, you realize that this dark world is simply a place you like to be.

Though there are plenty of opportunities to get through situations by talking, more often than not violence is the only solution so abilities are weighted toward combat and stealth making it hard to end the game with less aggressive characters. The cast is lively and colorful and most of the voice acting is very appropriate. You can really get attatched (Oh how I loved VV) to the people who spend their lives and unlives in you.

If you let your humanity slip, you?ll approach the world as an immoral monster. High seduction? You?ll find good looks can get you farther. While some have described the combat as ?clunky? I haven?t found it so at all. It does depend heavily on your stats, so if you don?t put points into combat related attributes and talents, expect to have your butt handed to you on a regular basis. My only complaint is the lack of clothing/character model options. If you could change your look a bit more, it would be a totally immersive game. I?ve had no major graphics glitches, and I?m running an athlon xp 2600, 1 gb of ram, radeon 9600 128mb graphics. Hardcore VtM fans will note some significant departures from the pen and paper system, but I?ve found most of these compromises helped the flow of the game, and contributed to the overall experience.

Once you get past the mediocre 45 minutes of a tutorial, that's when the game truly begins. It starts off more like a crime/noir style story with vampires, but eventually you get to try out all sorts of missions, ranging from full-on action, to stealth, to horror. The RPG elements are very good, because in the beginning you get to choose to play as one of 7 clans, all possessing different strengths, weaknesses, and special abilities. And as you progress through the game, you can choose to level up any of the available skills, and there are many. The story itself is pretty good too, many of the characters are memorable, and many of the locations are pretty atmospheric (even though some missions are really bland, like the sewers level). I'd say the game gives off some Deus Ex and GTA vibes, except with vampires. Now then, the game has aged quite significantly over the years and you can quickly see that the combat mechanic is nothing special. However, since the game is not all about combat, this is not a big flaw. Overall, if you've tried to explore and do all the sidequests, a single playthrough should last you at least 30 hours, and since you can play as up to 7 clans, the game has a good replayability; and although the story is very linear, the game has lots of sidequests, and of course multiple endings. So I'd say it's one of the better RPGs I have played.\"]\n",

Sadly it is unfinished, but I knew this before I started playing it, so I got the patch recommended on the Steam forums have experienced relatively minor issues, such as: a rat that didn't drop after drinking its blood, 2 unimportant AIs getting stuck in a corner, and buffering in a conversation every now and then. But I can ignore them because of the depth and immersion this game has which really gives you the terror of living in this mythological world, then contrasted to how fun the combat is, which provides a challenge but doesn't make you want to hit your head on the wall until one of the two breaks. Oftentimes I find myself much more afraid of breaking the masquerade than myself dying, which gives the game a unique fear not like other games.\"]\n",

            "Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines [\"Based on the tabletop-RPG of the same name, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is a curious story. Shortly after launch, the highly talented Troika Games closed after a poor commercial release due to the incomplete state the game was released in, courtesy of Activision. It's bug ridden, clunky, unfinished, and absolutely laborious towards the end, but V:TMB prevails as a masterwork in video game writing and one of my favorite RPGs ever.\\r\", ' ', \"Set in the modern backdrop of night time Los Angeles, V:TMB is a dark fantasy that depicts a vampire society more or less unknown to humans, only able to thrive as the sun goes down. While it seems like fairly simple fiction to take on, the setting the game exists in is so well realized and captivating that it feels plausible. This is thanks to the writing which is, for lack of words, easily the finest in any game I've played. Many babble on how great writing should make you emotional and connect with characters, but V:TMB's writing is a darkly beautiful exception. It's script embraces its source material, an enthralling mix of exposition, criticism, foreshadowing, tragedy, satire, and even philosophy. One moment you're hypnotized in the seductive nightlife, then thrust in palpable unease, giving you food for thought the next, and cherry topped by making you laugh your ass off. It's all conveyed in a way that rewards your curiosity and respects your intelligence.\\r\", ' ', \"The characters that inhabit this universe also benefit from the game's script. From the witty Smiling Jack to the pompous Prince LaCroix to the flirtatious yet playful Jeanette, all of V:TMB's characters have interesting personalities. Everyone has their own little idiosyncrasies and each feel like they've existed long before you arrived. You'll listen to what they have to say not because they might have a reward for use, but because you're so invested in learning about this world and its inhabitants. It's a critical, yet honest in-depth take on vampire society in this strange, fascinating world, all without trying to be superficially mature or cheesy. It helps that the characters are superbly voice acted, elevating the god-tier writing that much more. If any game can make a character in a comical, sociocritical horror story with an abusive childhood lead to a jaw dropping twist, whilst maintaining a tactful undertone of cynicism and playful humor, it's this game.\\r\", ' ', \"The gameplay, despite its rough look, is true to its pen and paper origins. You begin by picking a clan, and each vampire has their own set of skills and bonuses to suit your desired play style, not to mention a noticeable effect in how the world reacts to you. From the charming Toreador to the insane Malkavian, the game gives plenty reason to experience multiple playthroughs. Quests you take on are diverse and each task completed nets you skill points, and these can be spent on both passive and active abilities, all of which have an immediate effect in how you play the game. The level design adds to this by making exploration rewarding but also granting you a range of ways to tackle your objective from persuasion, stealth, and brute force if need be. And speaking of levels, The Ocean House Hotel mission alone is an experience worth the price of admission. Staying true to the universe, the game lets you harness your vampire abilities in a believable, yet gameplay sound fashion. Blood serves as a gauge for your abilities, and balances it out by your need to feed. On the downside, the combat isn't as successful. Against moronic AI, landing blows with melee weapons feels awkward as hell and firearms lack punch.\\r\", ' ', \"Among other aspects, the game definitely looks its age. Based on the early build of the Source engine, characters' facial animation are still better than many games today. Other than the decent textures and pleasing color palette, everything else resembles 2004. Level geometry is basic and characters' faces appear comically stiff. The game's overall presentation is fairly nicked, but is saved by an immersive atmosphere and a sublime soundtrack. The composer incredibly manages to craft a soundtrack that oozes feelings that encapsulates this sinister, intoxicating LA nightlife.\\r\", ' ', \"Despite it's triumphs, V:TMB's is far from perfect. The last fourth of the game is plagued by awful level design that doesn't cater to multiple playstyles, instead forcing you into either combat or light stealth, resulting in frustrating boss fights towards the end. The game is peppered with bugs and glitches for days, and an endgame plot that rushes itself. The finale, while fitting, lacks input from earlier choices due to the rushed development.\\r\", ' ', \"V:TMB had plenty potential to be one of gaming's finest works, but its unfinished state and overall lack of polish makes downloading a fan patch essential. Even with all it gets wrong, V:TMB gets so much right. It's a hidden gem that invites you into its world of darkness, an experience worth the eventual sunrise.\"]\n",

Some community mods are pretty neat and greatly change the way the game plays, there are forums that discuss that and they are well worth checking out.\\r', ' ', \"However, I've played through the vanilla game with bugfixes only. Maybe some minor graphics facelift mod, I forgot by now.\\r\", ' ', \"As it is unmodded - the game already has a lot of variety built in: most notably playing as Nosferatu vs. a Venture for example is pretty much like playing the same game after some sort of Total Conversion mod - it's that much different.\\r\", ' ', \"This game was released in 2004 a few months after HL2, and in terms of visual quality it doesn't even try to come close. Except for characters - the characters in VTM are truly AAA production quality for the time. The world detail... it feels like a B-grade movie. But a good one! Some things are clearly low-budget, but they are very honest about it, and it only annoys you for a second - after that you get involved with the story and atmosphere which is truly engaging!\\r\", ' ', \"The sneaking in this game feels... very artificial at times. Like as long as you're crouched, maintain a certain distance (like 10 meters) and move slowly enough - you can creep right in front of an enemy in plain sight when they are seemingly looking right at you. Other times they notice you even if you're absolutely still and completely concealed behind some crate, if they wander close enough. Meh :-|\\r\", ' ', \"And the shooting. Don't get the sniper rifle if you haven't maxed you 10/10 your Firearms skill. The aritificial sway is so gross it will make pretty much unusable. That said, the game maps aren't big enough for you to even need a sniper rifle.\\r\", ' ', \"The world is quite small overall, tbh. Even for a 2004 game. It's basically 4 main outdoor zones, and a dozen or so quest-specific zones. It's a dense urban environment however, and while linear size end-to-end is quite small - most buildings have something interesting in them. But it's not like vanilla Witcher-3 where exploring buildings and looting stuff is almost a chore. Here you won't be collecting tons and tons of crap to dump off to a vendor for 1/5 of their price. There is an amazing amount of unique discoverable content packed within like a few city blocks. Certainly worth exploring.\\r\", ' ', \"The best weapons and gear in the game you either buy for a hefty sum from one of the traders, get from NPCs that you get friendly enough with for doing favors for them. Much like in real life - you don't just lockpick house after house to eventually find some epic machinegun in a drawer in someone's bedroom :-D\\r\", ' ', 'The player\\'s character, referred to as \"the fledgling\", feels a bit OP most of the time, but there are moments when you get attacked by particularly powerful enemies without much of a warning or clear indication.

When creating a character, you choose from the different races of the Vampire rpg-world. I played as a Ventrue, the leader-race of Vampire-society. The great rpg experience and level-up point system as well as the talk-mode reminds me of Fallout, which is not surprising since Troika made the game, and I sincerely hope this tradition will live on, as this appeals to me.

It never got to be a horror game, but the feeling of creepiness was constant and oppressive - the designers took obvious inspiration from horror movies while adapting their rhythm to that of the World of Darkness lore. All of this would have been useless had Bloodlines fallen prey to the hysterical need of many a modern game to handhold the player and scream the plot in your face; fortunately it didn't do any of that. Another big point in the game's favor is the way different races impact gameplay, and while this aspect isn't perfect, playing as a Malkavian differs a lot from playing as a Ventrue.\\r\", ' ', \"While it does have some flaws - the action-based combat, the rushed final act, and Troika's hallmark lengthy unskippable dungeons full of enemies - what elements it does well, it does very well.

Let me boil it down in 3 points.\", \"1) Absolutely UNIQUE play style between many bloodlines (races) way beyond simple +1 to melee or +2 to spell damage.  The extent of which is still unmatched in any game to date.  Ex:  One bloodline have you hiding in sewers, making old lady faint from the sight of you.  Another bloodline have you manipulating people's mind with psychotic hilarity.  It's a step-up addition to the traditional persuader, gunner, slasher, sneaker, hacker approaches that this game also has.  Except this step-up doesn't just play different, it FEELS different.\", '2) The more outrageous the character, the more difficult it is for the writer to maintain the suspension of disbelief.  This game has some of the wildest characters in video game and I never blinked.  The game is so filled with great nuggets of excellent writing/design that if you keep exploring, you constantly keep getting amused for many playthrough.', '3) FULLY voiced game with some of the most convincing voice-over in video game.  Combine this with the most effective facial and body animation to add body language.   The characters feel so alive and believable.  Compare this to the character animation and voice work of Half Life 2 (original) and Knights of the Old Republic, and you can see what a technical marvel this game was.  Play the dialogue scenes of this game, then switch to \"modern\" titles like Fallout 3 or Mass Effect 2.   The game was not just ahead of its time, it\\'s still ahead in our time.

What fascinates me is how the actual game itself- the round based gameplay- gets boring too quickly. Everything becomes too predictable because the maps are so linear. I spent barely any time playing the actual game and more time exploring mods and deathmatches and new maps. Of course there are plenty of intense moments but even if this is the case, there's never anything new. You've seen everything there is to see before the gmae starts. Yes it's a good thing so that inexpereinced players can jump in and play, but I feel that with the recent updates Valve could have added new game modes instead of just adding achievements, stats tracking (a bit late for that after 6 years the game had been out) and the updated game engine. To really enjoy this game how it should be played you need to either play at a LAN party with people you know just for fun or if you play online make sure you're on a decent server. There's so many intolerant players that are arrogant and have no respect for newcomers. What's most difficult is finding servers to suit your ksill level. One full of noobs becomes boring, as does getting headshotted immediately by pros who shoot at the floor with AK47 and somehow kill you. It's definitely not a game that you just go out, buy, play and enjoy.\"]\n",

            "Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne [\" I've been a PC gamer for close to 25 years now, and MP2 is one of my favorite gaming experiences ever. Considering entertainment had while playing, it might be the most enjoyable shooter I ever played, Half-Life and other titans included. (Half-Life might be a better game, and have a much larger scope, but I enjoyed MP2 much more.) The graphics were (and still are) great; clean, crisp, and ridiculously efficient. The cornball film noir story is a treat. The sounds and music are superb. Mona Sax is an awesome anti-heroine; and for sheer butt-kicking sexy, I'd take her over Alyx Vance or Laura Croft any day of the week. Truth be told, some levels are narrow and poorly designed, and there is plenty of re-hashing of environments. But some maps (and the action embedded therein) are so creative and memorable that the game overcomes whatever negatives it could be charged with. Playing the same level twice, once from Mona's perspective, once from Max's is pure pleasure. The Funhouse level deserves to be in the computer game map hall of fame. I could go on an on. If for some reason you haven't played MP2 and you've got ten bucks to spend, search the 'value game' section or the bargain bin and pick up MP2. By the way, there will be no MP3-- Alan Wake will be the next Remedy game, built on essentially the same formula.

And in the middle of it all, Max Payne is trapped, still madly running from his past and his memories, and desiring death, finds instead a reason to live again.

            "Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne [\" This game is badly over-hyped. Gameplay is VERY similar to the previous game. They've added a few graphic flourishes to bullet-time, but things overall feel the same as before. What kills the game, in my opinion, are the excessive, poorly written, cut-scenes. I'm only a couple chapters into the game, but it seems that basically I get to play for 5 mins, then watch some stupid cut-scene for 3 mins. This is made worse by the fact that each cut-scene is accompanied by load-times going into and out of the scene. Ridiculous load times, considering that most of the scenes are just a few comic-book pages with voice-over. Even worse, the writing is horrid. Max Payne's over-the-top usage of metaphors and imagery is OK at first, but when you're into your 5th or 6th scene, and Max is still babbling like some fool on LSD - it gets tiring. The graphics look good overall, but certainly aren't any match for the upcoming Half Life 2 or Doom 3. One bad thing about the graphics - all characters wear the same, blank, expression. They all kind of look like creepy barbie dolls gone mad. This is especially noticable when watching a cut scene using the game engine. The physics engine is very realistic in the way things fall, drop down the stairs, etc. However, pretty much everything is indesctructible (including cardboard boxes), which isn't so realistic... Anyway, this is overall an OK game, just don't expect something revolutionary. I think most of the scores out there are over-inflated. \"]\n",

            "Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne [' Max Payne 2 is a gorgeous game, to be sure. The environments are mostly \"destructible\", and somewhat interactive. Bullet time has been reworked, as have some of Max\\'s moves. Gone is the much derided \"Poopy-diaper sneer\" that he wore in the first game. Characters have detailed facial structure, mouths moving in accordance to spoken words. \"Rag doll\" physics seem to be a standard feature in most games recently, and the feature is used here to good effect, the bodies having the right weight and characteristics. Still used is the trade comic-book plot frames, which defined the original game. This has been supplemented with some unbelieveably luscious cut-scenes. Though heavy on story and plot, cut-scenes offer a bit of rest from the frantic action. Truly the only major thing I have to grouse about is the length of the gameplay. Similar to the first game, you can finish the entire game in about 10 hours total. (I think the first game took me 8 hours.) I\\'d like to have seen more destruction, and a visible area damage system for bodies, similar to Soldier of Fortune II. Max Payne 2 is certainly an improvement over the first game, but not ground-breaking, by any means. The formula worked well on the first game, and I\\'m sure that Remedy Entertainment kept that in mind, while infusing Max Payne 2 with more gaming goodness. ']\n",

On the downside is repetetive game play as the obvious scripting really gets in your eye the third or fourth time you try to get through a tricky part. I also tended to die by falling down more often than by getting shot - the real reason for \"...the fall of...\"? And lastly it was kind of short - I was almost surprised when I realized I had played out the final scene. However, I picked it up a lot cheaper now in the fall -05 than when it was new so it was very much worth the money and I recommend any one who hasn\\'t played it yet to do so.']\n",

            "Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne [' Max Payne is big. Big enough to have a sequel. If the game is updated in graphics, the gameplay suffers a little bit, aside from the architecture. In my opinion, Max Payne first was a lot harder than the second. Max Payne gives himself looks of a God by surviving two extraordinary \"falls\", which is why the game is called The Fall of Max Payne. I\\'m not going to give you the juicy details, but the game packs a bunch in terms of emotional detail. Contrary to the first, Max won\\'t go and attack the government head first and blow up every single building he enters. Instead, this starts with an investigation and the death of a woman (\"like all bad things in my life...\"). Max then gets involved so deeply with the case that it costs him the loss of trust by his closest friends. Then, those he first meddled with come back to him and the miraculous survivor struggles again against all odds to find the truth in the dark. But how deep will he have to dig? Some moments are perplexing yet others are very obvious. Everything is not what it seems and Max finds himself caught into dreams that are creepier one after the other. I admit that some dreams with the correct sound devices and a night alone in a basement can give you the creeps. The gameplay itself shows how the characters you fight are but dummies with big guns. What\\'s lame? Well, the fact that you can clear a room by running head first into the pack and with a full bullet-time gauge. I mean this at ANY point at all in the game. What would have been good also would have been the change in weaponry. You often end up seeing the same weapons everywhere. I mean, sure, it\\'s gangsters against highly trained killers, but why do they all fight the same way with the same weapons? Everything seems so chaotic that Max himself looks lost at most points in the game. Finishing the game makes you breathe a little because the last intense moments are quite silly for the most part. This isn\\'t a game to use your brain with. It\\'s a game that works like an action movie and a depressing scenario with lugubrious music to join it. I will say that Max has Mel Gibson looks on some shots. Wonder why Mel won\\'t be playing him in the movie?']\n",

            "Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne [\" A couple years back, I tried the demo, and I liked it; but, I never really got into the game. Only reason being is that I was really into more of a science fiction action. In a sense this is fiction. But I was more interested in robots, aliens, and monsters. Lately, though I have started to introduce some modern setting action games to my collection. I wouldn't go far back as to buy the first Max Payne, 2003 is a good borderline for gamers who like newer games. But, for the price it is on Steam now, it was well worth it. The graphics are dated, but for its time, they were quite an advance, and they also still capture the games atmosphere well. I think after playing Half Life 2 so much, I can almost compare it, although being slightly dumbed down, as things are a bit off scale at times. I think any computer these days will be able to Max :) the graphics, and enjoy the full well done detail. The level design is tight, and some surreal level design for dream sequences or other misc things, were artistically thought out. The action like most 3rd person action games, feels a bit clunky at times, and takes some getting used to. But, still manages to be very enjoyable. The best part is the hardened detective story, and its well told, along with great voice acting on all parts. When an action game that is linear tries to tell a story, it has to do it well. Max Payne 2 has an entertaining, realistic, and enjoyable story all the way.\"]\n",

            "Freelancer [\" A game that should get a 10 on intuitive controls, crunchy visual and sound effects, and an interesting backdrop of elective activities to a reasonably interesting storyline instead loses points. While a novice gamer might enjoy Freelancer a great deal for a time before moving on to another game, longtime fans of the genre had much higher hopes for the evolution of the space trading sim. While not game has quite come close to the magic of the legendary Elite that started it all with huge areas of space to explore, a variety of mission types, and a relatively high level of ship customization. Since we've seen Privateer, quite similiar to Freelancer, created by the same legendary designer of Wing Commander. Most notably were Terminus which featured detailed ship creation and modification, a dynamic economy and advanced, persistant, ship AI that could form ad hoc alliances or emnities with other vessels even to the point of posting bounties on each other or the player. X: Beyond The Frontier allowed the lone trader to create his own supply and distribution chains in space to the point of creating his own factories, stations and fleets while competing with other factions for resources. Freelancer brings us, once you step around the fairly interesting if rehashed linear storyline, a very static universe if a stunningly beautiful and visually varied one. While ships fly in formations and chat with each other and the station the economy they supposedly ply is static - prices never change. Hence once you learn a good route you're set for life. There are many factions but they're all but interchangable as they offer identical mission types (go there - blow that or them up). The relationships between them are as unchanging and void of surprises as the economy is. A player can never really get attached to his ship either as the 'rpg' based levelling system compels the player to buy a more powerful ship as soon as he gets to a high enough 'level'. Ship customization is woefully superficial and limited. Also, while there is a small variety of ship classes (Light Fighter, Heavy Fighter and Freighter) ultimately all players will end up with Heavy Fighters as all missions involve intense combat - even trade. Light Fighter and Freighter variants are unavailable at all for the highest levels of play. Multiplayer, while admittedly fun, does have many shortcomings. First, the static nature of the universe makes the natural tendancy of players to offer each other help a losing proposition. If the entire point of playing this style of game is exploration and discovery having that all handed to you on a silver platter ruins the game. Players have reported that, running the best routes, they can max out in power in a matter of hours. Once you're at the top of the food chain what's left to do? Static factions dictate you can't effect the various conflicts brewing. Ship vs. ship combat works much better in true sims than in arcade games in which turn, burn, and shoot are the only tactics available. There's not much of dogfight to be had. All this said, Freelancer still gets 6 out of 10 because there will be folks who will enjoy it. There's beauty and some crunchy gameplay in an evocative setting.

The PC port performs poorly at times jumping from 60 fps to 30 fps on high end PCs.  It's a poor game functionally and it's got the worst story out of the first four games in the series.\"]\n",

The story of this game is probably the best out of all SH games, 10/10 the music and sound effects are ok and the voice acting is similar to the first game, just akward but that just adds to the atmosphere of the game it actually helps it 10/10. The controls and gameplay are similar to the first game as well a little clunky but they are fine once you get used to them 9/10. The graphics are way better than the first game but they don't scare as much and the game lacks of world to otherworld transitions not to mention there isn't as much variaty or uniqueness about the enemies you encounter and the boss fights aren't that good either 8/10. Final veredict is 9/10 not the best SH ever IMO but almost, it just needed that extra push in enemy model creativity and scarier atmosphere(lacks a little the fear element) to have been the best. Just to add another observation is that I have never played the console verion of this game but the PC version and maxing out all the settings this game looks great almost like an xbox360 game, almost.\"]\n",

Game got my attention not by it's realism or story that based on real events, hell no, this game is pure magic that kinda based on actual story, but with Cyclopses, Colossuses (is that right?) and freaking Gods. All right, first things first, story is really good, it develops slow, but when you will reach Egypt levels plot will surprise you with some cool bad-ass moments and twists. Gameplay is your basic Age of mechanic, but here you also have power of Gods, you can unlock 4 unique abilities and by gaining, you know, God's love, you can create such creatures as Giants, Trolls, Cyclopses and other cool monsters. There's 4 different cultures and each of them are actually different and unique, trust me, because of that replay value is very high. My only complain is that story is REALLY slow and you will be bored of it by the chapter 20. There are bad-ass moments, but also tons of useless and forgettable ones.

Like any other \"Age of\" game by ensemble studios and microsoft studios, there is leveling up. However, in Age of Mythology, you get god powers from leveling up throughout the ages. there are four ages to level up to, (five if you have the titans expansion) all of which you choose which Minor God you wish to worship. Worshiping and minor god provides you with new Myth Units, which you can train from your Temple, and god powers. (In the titans expansion at the 5th age you get a titan gate, which lets you build a structure that releases a titan which is basically one big super-unit, but isnt too over-powering.) Like I said above, I spent literally my whole childhood playing this game, singleplayer against bots, the campaign, both amazing experiences, and before Microsoft shut down the servers for AoM, the online community was great. During the campaign you follow an Atlantean Hero, Arkantos, who at first defends Atlantis from a bandit attack, it doesnt seem like much, but then the bandits steal the trident from the statue of Poseidon. Arkantos takes a few soldiers with him and chases after the bandits and their known leader, Kamos. You find Kamos and fight him, and defeat him, only for him to get away, but even though he gets away you take the trident back. The rest of the campaign goes into detail about Greek, Egyptian, and Norse mythology, and follows Arkantos as he sets out on a quest to ensure that the titan Kronos does not escape from his prison in Tartarus, by keeping all the Tartarian gates closed despite the fruitless effort of Kronos\\' followers. This game has quite a few plot twists, (which are for the better) and it has a very compelling story.

Each god will grant you special god powers along with technologies and mythic units. The downside is, having all of these options leads to a certain god to be overpowered and will dominate the other gods. Ensemble studios has now pretty much have each god to be equal to each other, yet it was a very bumpy start for AOM.

            "Age of Mythology ['The best „Age of“ game. It adds gods, mythological beasts / units and favor (faith) to the mix and has a remarkable story campaign based of Greek, Norse and Egyptian legends aka methodology. It is the same real time strategy concept as the other “Age of” games. You are gathering the resources\\r', \"gold, wood, food and added for this game favor (faith) to develop your kingdom. With the resources you can construct buildings, create units and research improvements. For a bigger chunk you can advance to a new age (archaic to classic to heroic to mythic age) each time unlocking new stuff. There are 3 different factions with Greeks including Atlanteans, Egyptians and Norse (Vikings). The new parts are the gods. You start with one of the main gods of the pantheon including bonuses and with each advancement you can chose between 2 different additional gods with different improvements. For example the Greek god of metalwork, blacksmiths and carpenters Hephaestus will give you benefits for weapons and armor in each age. Also each god gives you access to a one time wonder (magic). This can be a benefit like for example a charm that attracts deer to make hunting faster (and more productive), a meteor strike or a treasury with a slow but steady gold income. The higher the age the better the wonder. Of cause there are mythological units you can unlock. Greek have for example Minotaurs, Centaurs and legendary heroes, Norse have Giants, Trolls and Valkyries and Egyptians have (giant) Scarabs, Sphinxes (multitude of Sphinx), and Mummies to name a few. Each mythological improvement or unit needs favor (faith), How this is acquired is depending on the faction and is well researched. Greeks get it by sending workers to temples for praying, Egyptians by building monuments and Vikings / Norse by fighting (lesser by hunting and fishing). This alone gives variation but it ends not there as all factions have more difference. For example: While Egyptians have weaker units (until later ages) they have priests that can heal while the other factions are very limited in this. Norse have wagons that work as mobile storage houses while the others have to build appropriate buildings. Greeks have stronger units but those are more expensive and the favor gathering limits your resource gathering and available unit number. To shorten this the gameplay is excellent, balanced and enjoyable. It is a game that you will replay from time to time and a true classic. Now to the story. Like I said it is excellent and uses old legends aka methodology (I know that the time frame is wrong but I don't care as it is entertainment not accurate history or methodology). You play as Arkantos admiral and hero of Atlantis. He was on his way to retirement but a war between their independent Greek colonies and the Trojans broke out and it would be an insult to send a lesser military leader to their aid. He does not know that this Trojan war will just be a small prelude to a far bigger conflict. The story is excellent and uses a lot of elements from lore and legends. They exceeded all my expectations here as it is far more than just simply connecting missions. A lot of games in the genre fail in this regard and so I should praise this even more. Also it is really long with 32 scenario's. Those are diversified and never felt boring. Atop of this there is also a multiplayer mode and a really good editor for you to create your own scenarios. Graphically it looked really good for its time but aged a bit which I see not as a negative. Especially the introduction cinematic was truly excellent. The soundtrack is still excellent. No matter how often I replay the game it becomes never boring nor fails to deliver. Overall this is my favorite game in the franchise and probably also in the real time strategy genre. An easy recommendation and I hope they continue the franchise in the future with new games.\"]\n",

I do not really care much about the acting of the actors as this is a review of the game and not the movie.

I had never bored playing this game and still playing till now (June 2012). Thank\\'s to the fans and C&C community on this. There is no doubt that Red alert 3 and its expansions Uprising had a much better graphics. But Red Alert 2 & Yuri revenge definitely had a better story lines and missions. I wish they could be reproduced or remastered it in a better graphics. Command & Conquer 3 and 4 are not even close to compare. I played Command & Conquer 4 and stop at mission 3 or something.

Taking away the irritating mandatory combat in TTDP, Thief 2's strengths such as the sprawling non-linear levels, engaging stealth, brilliant writing and characterisation shine all the brighter. The characters all feel unique; even the guards have an endearing daftness to them as they flamboyantly make conversation while you watch from the shadows (keep a look out for Benny, especially). In fact, I'm hard pressed to say anything bad about it except nitpicks; the gameplay doesn't add much from TDP, the graphics are a bit ugly (even for 2000) and it's not quite as tense or original as the first game.

Also, on Steam you can hook up your Xbox controller, it’s a little finicky but it works.\\r', ' ', '1. AUDIO. It’s amazing, you’ll want to use headphones. The enemies’ footstep sounds are omnidirectional, so you always know where enemies are based on their footsteps, when they cough, talk, or whistle etc. you’ll know how close or far away they are.  You can stand at a door, lean into it and hear the footsteps or talking on the other side. Modern games’ sound engines are not able to do any of this. Modern graphics are so demanding that they’re not able to map sound realistically.  Thief 2 creates it’s environment to interact with sound in a real way. Sound waves bounce and carry differently based on the materials and design of the space. So if there’s stone everywhere, sound bounces and echos and travels far. But if there’s a steel door, it will be harder for sound to penetrate to the other side.  And if you can hear enemies, they can hear you, so you have to walk on wood or carpet, if you walk on loud marble they’ll come looking for you.\\r', ' ', '2. SHADOWS.  You don’t have a radar system like in metal gear that shows you where the enemies are and their line of sight, and you can’t see through walls like in dishonored, all you have is a “light gem” at the bottom of the screen that shows how visible you are. If you’re in shadow, the gem is dark and you’re invisible, and if the gem is lit up everyone can see you. Your weapons consist of a useless sword, your trusty blackjack (knock out people that you sneak up on from behind), and a bow and arrow. You have normal arrows, rope arrows (can stick to any wooden surface for you to climb up), explosive arrows, moss arrows (used to soften your footsteps on marble), and most importantly, water arrows! These put out torches making more shadows for you to hide in. So as a thief, you are much stronger in the shadows, whereas the opposite in a horror game like Doom 3, when you see a room full of shadows you get scared of what could be lurking in there. The design is so ridiculously detailed, that when you’re crouched in shadow you shouldn’t have your sword out because it will light up your gem and enemies will see you...because light reflects off of metal! Duh! Lol The money you steal in each mission is used to purchase your gear for the next missions (stock up on those water arrows!), and you get more tasks to do the more you increase the difficulty! So on easy mode you’ll have 2 tasks, hard you’ll have 5 or 6 etc.\\r', ' ', '3. LEVEL DESIGN.  They make each level feel like a real place.  The opening mission blew my mind with how large it is.  It’s a full mansion and it’s built like a real sized mansion. There’s another where you rob a bank...they feel so real I could draw you a complete map from memory from exploring all of these places, and they’re so detailed that all of the loot is accurate to the locations. There won’t be money in the kitchens, but you’ll find some in a safe in the master bedroom. But there are notes to read everywhere, and enemies having conversations, that provide more detail and context to the world and the places you’re robbing.  You’ll find a note or hear a conversation that says the chef has been stealing money and where he’s been hiding it in the kitchen, then you go to that location and steal it from him.  I’ve played this like 6 times, and still have not found all of the hidden secrets. The Prima game guide to this is a great thing to order on amazon.\\r', ' ', 'There are so many things I could say, like how there aren’t any quest markers like in all modern games.  You have a crude, hand drawn map that doesn’t tell you exactly where you are and you have to explore and completely immerse yourself to complete levels. The soundtrack is AMAZING and so original. The story is mature and subtle with beautifully hand drawn cutscenes. The main character’s voice acting is addicting perfection, you can’t wait for the next time he talks.  It’s all incredible you will have the time of your life. For a 90’s game, even though it came out in 2000, it has the same design principles as the first game from 1998, you have complete freedom of movement, no invisible walls, you can go anywhere and climb and jump on anything while slithering through the shadows. You’ll be amazed with what you can get away with in a game that’s almost 20 years old.  The majority of modern games can’t claim that. 10/10']\n",

            "Thief II: The Metal Age ['For the sake of brevity and as a gesture of respect to the older audience (myself included), I think \"Thief\" and this sequel are pretty genre defining titles that have forever left a mark on the industry, even as that very industry seeks to undo more and more every year of what it built upon so many, many, many years ago.  That all being said, these games are totally obsolete, even archaic and without outright saying anything negative to anyone SPECIFICALLY, if you enjoy them in this current year then it might be time to change your calendar and or start shopping for walkers.\\r', ' ', \"Some kidding aside, Thief 2 is incredibly old.  Its kind of like breaking out a very old jigsaw puzzle where some of the pieces are missing chunks, or have been covered up by stains, or are just simpy missing after years of putting the puzzle together and then placing the pieces back in the box.  It isn't a bad game by any means, but it will require a bit of imagination to fill in the blanks, such as the A.I. being about as intelligent as a Dumbo rat skittering about a small room with the lights switched off.  Or the sound design reeking of that ancient EAX reverb that sounded like two plumbers banging on your water pipes in your basement while you were one floor above them, and don't forget about the absolutely labyrinthine levels that are deceptivally tiny, but were made difficult to navigate on purpose so as to pad out the runtime.\\r\", ' ', 'I suppose their is also a \"plot\" to the Thief games, but since that was flushed down the toilet since the ill-fated 3rd installment, we can pretty much self-insert as Garrett at this point, and honestly isn\\'t that what the original developers intended?  I think so anyway.  All the charm of Thief 2, very quickly fades away as soon as you realize how dull most of your objectives actually are.  Your first \"mission\" is mostly a tutorial, but you can\\'t even mess it up and your actual opponents a.k.a. mostly rent-a-guard\\'s- are even less suspicious then they were in your first outing.  Thief 2 has larger levels, which unfortunately totally breaks the A.I. routines, meaning they won\\'t even do a lot of what made the original game so interesting.  Gone are the days when guards would actually investigate odd noises, Garrett\\'s tap-dancing rat shoes or torn tapestries.. instead we get guards turning on a dime back and forth on the same set path, which is about as easy to avoid as a comically thrown custard-pie.  Quite simply it totally ruins the original\\'s attempt at having knowledgeable (or at least its attempt at convincing you it was) artificial intelligence.\\r', ' ', 'Texture-wise its much like the original game with some modest improvements.  Lighting or lack of lighting is improved with a better sense of what constitutes patches of darkness for Garrett to slowly crouch or sneak in and the dialogue is just as well written, as their is more of it to begin with between many NPC\\'s and other characters.  The music is still probably some of the best in the stealth genre with a lot of building on eerie soundscapes that builds the further you explore and loot or the nearer you get to certain areas of levels.  However, its the gameplay itself that has been usurped.  Its not like picking up \"Splinter Cell - Chaos Theory\" or \"Metal Gear Solid,\" which are honestly just better paced then any of the Thief games could\\'ve ever hoped to have been.\\r', ' ', \"So in earnest, I've never gone beyond the first mission in Thief 2, the original is still pretty endearing, if not just kind of like peering into a time capsule of 1998, but the second mission in Thief 2 just completely grinds the game to a halt.  This large warehouse, with coded padlock doors, and multiple entrances, and multiple objectives, and multiple enemies just irks me in a way that is well.. boring.  Its boring to play and if its not compelling or interesting or isn't presenting me with new ideas?  Then yes its going to be pretty darn difficult to care about progressing.  Lets leave Thief as a reminder of what we strive for in stealth games, but it shouldn't be lauded in this current decade as something that can stand the test of time, otherwise we'd all still be running Windows 98 and personally I can't find a harddrive small enough to be bothered to try it anymore.\\r\", ' ', 'Tfix, for those who have heard of it, is mostly just a way to actually play the game beyond Windows 2000, and though its a great effort in many regards- it also permanently wipes out the original engine and its intricate quirks.  Old dark isn\\'t New Dark and vice versa.  Their are just some things that are more interesting the more \"pure\" they remain.  This would be like modding \"Doom\" to be a more modern FPS (oh wait they already did that).  HD \"mods\" and texture packs don\\'t really make the games less obnoxious or finicky to traverse and they certainly don\\'t make it look much better by today\\'s standards.  Your mileage may vary with Thief 2, but that isn\\'t a recommendation to bother playing it either.']\n",

Many people consider this game to have single handily have saved the single-player RPG genre on the PC just when it looked dead.  It represents a definite turning point in the history of gaming.  This can be hard to appreciate today because even I'll concede that the graphics are dated.  But the truth of the matter is that RPGs have never been about graphics anyway. What made Balder's Gate innovative it was the first RPG to actually use NPCs to advance the story in a mission critical way.  It put their stories, their personalities, their goals on a footing that was equal to your own.  What made it show-stopping was the nature of those personalities.  They were all different, all unique, and they all didn't necessarily care about you.  You had to not just manage combat but manage people if your little band was going to finish the game.\", 'Yes, the combat can be unbalanced at times.  There are a few bugs. But if you cannot laugh when Minsc shouts, \"Go for the eyes, Boo\" there is something wrong not with the game but with your life. If you want, you can break this game down and find all it\\'s flaws; they exist. But if you don\\'t cheer sitting in your chair when Minsc shouts, \"Butt kicking for Goodness!\" you have no heart.  This isn\\'t just so much a game as it is an experience. That, it seems to me, is what an RPG is all about. It\\'s about creating experiences; it\\'s about making memories. It\\'s playing your role to the hilt and loving it.  Baldur\\'s Gate might not have been the best, some people argue the sequel is better, but it was the first to offer that immersion in a way no other game had up until that point in time.

In addition to the good characters, nice story lines, clean interface and good game play you find in Fallout, Torment, Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights as well as in the sequel to BG there is a great sense of exploration in this game. Even with repeat runs there is a powerful compulsion to fully reveal all the maps to make sure you haven`t missed anything, and above all most of the areas in the game are totally optional.

Similarly archers are a pain in the butt, and single ones will oneshot low level mages while a group of them will make you tear your hair out. Of course the only solution to this is exploration to make sure you find all the gear, potions and spells you can possibly get your hands on to be able to survive.

            "Baldur's Gate [\"It is „The little Hobbit“ to „The Lord of the Rings“. It is a good game and laying the foundation for the Baldurs Gate franchise (Baldurs Gate 2 and Throne of Bhaal). Before you asked yes that is unfair to compare it to Baldurs Gate 2 but many of us started with Baldurs Gate 2 as even today it is considered as one of the best RPGs of all time and there were countless re-releases (=It was much easier to get). For itself it was the first RPG from BioWare and uses the second edition AD&D rules with some adaptations. It is set in the Forgotten Realms in Faerun. Your player character is an orphan who was adopted by Gorion. Gorion is a wizard, scholar and influential figure behind the curtains. The story starts when Gorion asked you to leaf their home of Candlekeep with him during the night. Before you get any answer you were ambushed and the attacker ask specifically for you. A fight started as Gorion wants to save you and while he succeed he dies. Luckily you are not alone as your childhood friend Imoen sneaked out and wanted to help you. So started your quest for answers and revenge. The main story is good with twist and revelations. There are tons of side-quest and a lot of areas to explore. One of the main strengths are the characters. Baldurs Gate crated so much great characters I still remember. Be it Minsc and Bo, Edwin (Edwina;-), Imoen and countless others. Gameplay wise it is solid D&D videogame style. Sadly you are limited in level (depends on character class) and have not as much choices in classes. It is the first part of a greater adventure. This will be my main (unfair) complain that Baldurs Gate 2 improved every aspect (I played it first). The graphics were good at its time but aged a bit badly. I don't remember the soundtrack so I wont judge it here. I think it has overall the same strengths as all Baldurs Gate games. An enjoyable story, immersive characters you are fully invested in and a world you like to explore. The final rating depends on what you expect. Later games improved the formula and I will say this decreased the rating. Hat I played this game before Baldurs Gate 2 I would have definitely given a 10/10. But others games made this unfairly look inferior. However it is the first RPG of BioWare and doing such a good job at the first try is remarkable. It was a long story of success before EA bought them. From there it was a downwards spiral. I give an 8/10 and a recommendation to play the games in order. I have heard there is a mod that lets you play all 3 games as one (Throne of Bhaal is here counted as part 3).\"]\n",

I knew before that this game was amazing, but upon finishing this game I knew that this was my favourite RPG I've played in my entire life.\\r\", ' ', \"Story/Characters- The main story is very well written and it's a mix of mystery, drama and action to keep you interested from start to finish. The Characters are well written and even though that their banter is limited in comparison to Baldur's Gate 2, their biography gives you an inside scoop of their opinions and a few of their small quests is honestly enough to let you know what kind of person they are. The side missions usually consists of fetch quests and the usual, kill this and get your reward kinda thing. But some fetch quests usually make it interesting by having some problem and you having to resolve the problem. Even though the side quests were repetitive in terms of its objective, the different plots, outcomes, twists and rewards make it more interesting than less of a chore.\\r\", ' ', \"Gameplay- This is where the game peaks in my humble opinion. I spent about 1 hours just figuring out what to play and reading through all the details of each character. And too this day I haven't seen a more complex character creation than I have in BG1. The different races, alignment, classes and subclasses make it very interesting and adds so much replayability because of this. And throughout the game you meet many NPCs which can also add gameplay features by customizing their classes as well and also leaving/adding new party members which also makes it add more replay value due to the many NPCs you meet and can roll with and you can even solo the game on your own. The combat in the game is also very complex and takes some time getting used to when playing for the first time, the combat is based on Advanced DnD so it is quite challenging when playing with no knowledge of DnD. But with a few guides and reading the manual, I can assure you that you get better in due time and also the combat gets harder throughout the game so that the games does get challenging overtime which is good so that you don't breeze through enemies throughout the endgame, but it doesn't amp up the difficulty too much. So overall the combat is tedious at first but very well done in the end.\\r\", ' ', \"Graphics & Music- Graphics are great at it's time, and the soundtrack is well composed and even in 2017 it still doesn't feel too dated. Sure for some it's off putting and quite static to look at, but with it's 2D graphics, it still shows a surprising amount of detail when compared to earlier 2D RPGs. So at it's time it was well done, but nowadays the graphics are quite decent but some may seem it is too dated. Soundtrack is well done and really makes atmosphere more interesting when walking in a dungeon or through the forests of cloakwood.\\r\", \"Overall- 10/10 with no doubt, even with a few bugs here and there it really didn't seem to annoy me because how well crafted this game is. I never had so much fun and emotion in a game since I played Deus Ex 1. The gameplay and story quality was really well done and too this day it was the longest game I've played through and never in my playthrough I felt the need that the story was waning or the gameplay was repetitive, I had the same exciting from when I started the game all the way to the end. This game is good, despite the graphics feeling a tad dated... the gameplay makes up for it for sure.\\r\", ' ', \"I have really high hopes for Baldur's Gate 2, and I've heard it's even better than Baldur's Gate 1 so I'm very excited to play through it.\"]\n",

I also wish it was slightly larger in scale and more to collect, but thats the hoarder in me and some hate that. Suprisingly long game which is a good thing. One odd thing to mention is that depending on what mission you are on, and when you are not in missions, you get random calls on your radio/walkie which can be like the same person calling within 5 seconds which you just talked to.

Only one player actually needs to buy the game; the other player can join in via the friend’s pass version of the game, which makes it pretty ideal for sharing it with another person.\\r', ' ', 'If there is a complaint about the core gameplay, it is that while it mixes things up a fair bit, it is never really THAT great. It is always decent to good, but it never really reaches the point of greatness.\\r', ' ', 'On the flipside, however, the plot and story are rather weak. The protagonists actually have a good reason to split up, but their daughter doesn’t understand what is going on and is upset by it. The book is basically a product of their daughter’s distress, but unfortunately, it ends up not working out very well story-wise, as while the problems the characters have are brought up, they are never actually addressed.\\r', ' ', 'This is a huge lost opportunity, as while each area is supposedly addressing some sort of issue they have, none of these areas actually address the issue – playing inside a cuckoo clock is a cute way to represent that they never have enough time for each other or for doing the things they want to do, but the actual story never actually presents any sort of solution for the fact that one of the characters is working too much to spend any time with the family, while the other resents the lack of time they have with them (and frankly, does a rather poor job of being a house-husband).\\r', ' ', 'The problem is that the game sort of acts like there is some sort of progress here, even though none of it makes much sense as a means of actually overcoming their real issues with each other. I would have liked for the game to either resolve the issues in some way, or at least present a potential solution, or else have the characters be like “None of this has anything to do with actually solving our problems!” and have it all end with them being like “Nope, we’re getting divorced anyway.” The ending of the game isn’t particularly good or earned, and while it is a bit ambiguous, it’s not all that great.\\r', ' ', 'In all fairness to the writing, though, while the overall plot is lousy, the actual dialogue and situations are often amusing, and there are definitely some funny lines. Still, this is not a game to be played for its story.']\n",

It takes Two has so much to offer because in every chapter there is something new to experience. The diversity of weapons and how to use them is great. I did not feel bored once through the whole game while getting entertained by the book of love and the jokes Cody and May made about each other. It is a true romantic Comedy and the exact thing you need if you loved the good old days of couch coop and having fun together with your actual friends and family. This game is an absolute multiplayer-story masterpiece and even though it is more focused on the brilliant mechanics and gameplay the visuals look great too and the game is running smoothly.

            "It Takes Two ['Making a co-op video game is a nearly suicidal endeavor. Keeping the interest of two people for a lengthy period of time is hard, and therefore, these types of games don’t tend to be very profitable. But is the development of one worth it? Well, when you have a game as well crafted as It Takes Two, it certainly is. First off, this is a 3D platformer, one of the most accessible genres, perfectly fitted for a co-op experience. Not only that, but it’s a good 3D platformer. The playable characters move so nimbly, and it’s so exciting to control them. Their movesets aren’t anything special, but they work really well to deliver a fine tuned experience in conjunction with the level design. This is a platforming video game, but it isn’t afraid to delve into other territories and genres. The gimmicks that take away from the platforming experience pan out really well. The dungeon crawler segment is surprisingly well made, and the more gimmicky boss fights are actually very well put together. You also have these mini-games scattered throughout the levels, which are a ton of fun on their own. There are some ideas like the kaleidoscope segment and the labyrinth toy that don’t work out too well, but those are few and far between. What I’m trying to say is that even with all of the gimmicks, this is a very consistent platformer that nails both movement and level design. It Takes Two is strictly a co-op experience, and it really couldn’t be anything else. Communicating with your partner to solve puzzles is absolutely necessary to beating this game. The title is actually a theme reflected many times throughout the game itself, both in storytelling and gameplay. In one level, one player has to put down nails, while the other uses a hammer. In another, each person is given one side of a magnet. Both players support each other throughout the game, meaning this is an experience that can only be had with a friend, and the game has good reason for being developed that way. On a storytelling front, It Takes Two does tend to fumble. Cutscenes feature a ton of expository dialogue, and it’s kind of unfortunate to see so much interesting symbolism just being explained through the method of ‘tell not show’. Even despite the overly descriptive dialogue, the story itself is charming, and that’s all you really need for this type of game. Overall the combination of really exciting level design that forces you to communicate with a friend, and gimmicks that are mostly well executed makes It Takes Two a co-op experience for the ages. 9/10.']\n",

            "It Takes Two ['Since the dawn of time, man has asked: What if Knack was pretentious? What if Psychonauts was boring? What if the mach speed sections of the 3D Sonic games were sluggish plods devoid of challenge? Unfortunately, Aristotle was not able to see the answer to these mysteries. More unfortunately, I was. It Takes Two comes to us from EA, a company most gamers know is a bunch of evil pricks, until they publish a game like this, the kind of indie title that people used to only pretend to like because its existence leant a veneer of artistic credibility to the medium of gaming. \"Look, look!\" they cry, fingers pointing, jaws slack, \"it\\'s not a sensory-overloading gorefest or barely disguised pornography! It\\'s a game about something! Please take my hobby seriously so I can feel less like a loser.\"\\r', ' ', 'To say that ITT feels like a game that only exists so its creator could show it off at GDC for indie cred and convention **** would be burying the lede. The game comes courtesy of Swedish-Lebanese film director, game developer, and douche, Josef Fares. A quick glance at Fares\\' creative portfolio reveals a true wellspring of imagination. Fares is a man who immigrated to Sweden from Lebanon as a child to flee the Lebanese Civil War, and his most mainstream successful film is \"Zozo\", about a Lebanese boy who flees to Sweden to escape his country\\'s civil war. The reason I credit it as having the most mainstream success of his filmography is because it was actually chosen to represent Sweden in the 78th Academy Awards \"Best Foreign Language Film\" category. Notice I did not say it was nominated for an Academy Award for \"Best Foreign Language Film.\" I bring this up only to mention that Fares is infamous for a deranged speech at The Games Awards where he (in addition to screaming \"this is my time to shine\" and correcting Geoff Keighley on the number of films he\\'s made) said F- the Oscars.\" It\\'s a sentiment I agree with, but one that unavoidably hits different coming from someone who was explicitly rejected BY the Oscars.\\r', ' ', 'But back on topic: The creative sterility reveals itself before you even load up the game. Following up his previous two games of \"Narrative-based co-op puzzle platformer\" and \"Narrative-based co-op generic 3rd person action game\", ITT is a narrative-based co-op puzzle platformer. You play as Cody and May, a couple on the verge of divorce who become doll versions of themselves in a magical representation of their house because their daughter is sad about it. Throughout the game, you platform through obvious metaphors as the game repeatedly assaults you with scenes of our heroes finding random objects, saying \"oh, remember how you used to play music? Remember how we used to go out and dance? Remember when we were young? Do you think we did a good job of unsubtly signaling to the audience that the story being told here is how we\\'ve drifted apart because our passions and youth have dwindled over the years?\" once every 5 minutes.\\r', ' ', \"If you've made it this far into the review (thanks for that) and you're curious about the gameplay, it's fine. As I said three paragraphs ago, much of the game feels like the auto-scroller segments of a 3D Sonic the Hedgehog game had been slowed down to the point of childish simplicity, as if Hazelight found out the same secret Nintendo did, that you can take the same kinds of gameplay as a 3D Sonic title, tighten the controls by 20%, and slow the scrolling down to the point of zero challenge, and trick people who'd otherwise keep dying, get frustrated, and declare it bad game design into thinking that it's a masterpiece. (Also, tightening the controls is a lot harder than it sounds, because it means longer development cycles and more money for QA testing, and only companies with AAA money like, conveniently, Nintendo and EA, can really afford to eat the costs.) If the idea of Trine crossed with Mario Party excites you, you'd probably love this game. If that's what you want, then go for it, but I'll guarantee you there's a game like it already on Steam that's cheaper, longer than 15 hours, and doesn't force you to use Origin.\\r\", ' ', 'But it\\'s not the gameplay giving this game \"Best Game of 2021\" cred, it\\'s the story. It\\'s a twee, melodramatic indie game. In the minds of a certain demographic of male gamer (Funko collectors who still eat kid\\'s cereals in footie pajamas while watching cartoons) this kind of game is the closest thing you get to cultural legitimacy. As a story goes, it\\'s trash. The parents spend 95% of the game not even giving a F- about their kid, killing its sentient stuffed animal to make her cry for the purposes of breaking the spell, that NOT WORKING, and they not even feel bad for her. The stupid book explicitly telling you \"I\\'m only halting your progress to pad out the story.\" The climax is her singing a made up song without lyrics to arouse her husband into kissing her. These people are awful parents who clearly resent their child\\'s existence. Seriously, F- this game.']\n",

            "Hades ['Hades es uno de los mejores juegos indie que han salido hasta la fecha. Este roguelite ha llegado a ser uno de los mejores exponentes de su género gracias a su exquisita jugabilidad, sistema de progresión y curva de dificultad. La manera en la que cambia cada partida según el arma que elijas, las bendiciones que utilices y las decisiones permiten que el juego se haga muy entretenido de jugar, ya que cada partida que realices va a ser totalmente distinta a la anterior. Aquí entra el único punto débil del juego: la repetición de los enemigos para llegar hasta el final del juego. Tras finalizar la primera run, hasta llegar al final del juego hay que volver a pasárselo un número significativo de veces y, a pesar de que tras este final se añaden algunos enemigos e interacciones nuevas (incluso algunas mecánicas nuevas que dificultan el juego a cambio de una mayor recompensa), se hacen bastante escasos para la cantidad de veces que se te pide finalizar la run para llegar a los créditos. Esto provoca que las últimas runs que se realicen se hagan un tanto repetitivas ya que, además de este factor, las bendiciones ya no son sorprendentes y la repetición se hace notar demasiado. Añadiendo a este problema las interfaces poco intuitivas y mejorables, este juego es perfecto en todo lo demás. La historia me parece muy buena, intrigante y que consigue a través de su sencilla premisa que sea fácil de seguir y que te enganche. Cabe destacar que los arcos argumentales entre los personajes, que a su vez todos ellos son excelentes, son cada cual mejor y los hilos que se generan entre ellos generan que la historia sea muy completa y coherente. A esto se le añade el sistema de regalos, lo que permite profundizar sobre todos ellos. La mitología griega está perfectamente implementada en el juego, mediante diálogos, interacciones, intervenciones del narrador y descripciones de personajes y enemigos; siendo este uno de los pilares fundamentales del mismo. A nivel artístico es increíble, con personajes y escenarios memorablemente bellos; y la banda sonora también es excelente. He tardado unas 30 horas en pasármelo pero la duración puede variar mucho según la destreza del jugador. Un juegazo recomendable para todo el mundo. 9,2/10\\r', '(12/2021)']\n",

The combat feels punchy, and the multifarious mixture of weapons and single-run powers (boons) makes for a few hours of interesting combat.

They tend to have some shops that sell and buy stuff and some sort of mcguffin that powers you up permanently.

It is a brilliant solution to the problem that all roguelikes besides Hades bump up against: the feeling of futility between runs.\\r', \"I remember at one point in Dead Cells getting seriously far into the game. It was the culmination of a painstaking effort. And then I died and I was hurtled back to the start. And it was at that point, after so many deaths and runs, that I simply lost interest. As brilliant an action game as it was, that feeling of futility and lack of tangible progression gradually built up as I played, and eventually I just gave up. Hades turns this typical weakness of the genre into a strength: every time you die the plot advances. New characters stop you to chat, or old characters reveal some dark truth about themselves. You learn more. It means that death has less of a sting than in other roguelikes. Death becomes part of the rhythm of the game, even something necessary, rather than a dull bore. It's a subtle, elegant, complete solution to what has been up until now a big negative with the genre.\\r\", ' ', \"- The gameplay. It's been a long time since I've played something this addictive. The loop of risk/reward is relentless: you're never more than a minute or so away from some shiny trinket that'll buff your character and give you a little adrenaline rush. Combine that with simple but skillful and tactical twitch action and it's up there with Celeste and Super Meat Boy as one of the most compulsive games I've played in the last ten years.\\r\", ' ', 'CONS:\\r', ' ', \"- Well, it's a roguelike, and if you, like me, still have a problem with these kinds of games then there's no getting around that. However, Hades deals with the inherent flaws of the genre better than any other roguelike I've ever played. I dislike a lot of the baggage that accompanies this kind of game, especially procedurally generated levels. Yet the the game is so structurally exquisite I ended up not caring. It works around these flaws with such artistry, even turning some of them into positives.\\r\", ' ', \"- I'd say that the combat can get a little hard to read on the Switch. It's not a huge deal though.\\r\", ' ', \"That's about it for flaws...\\r\", ' ', 'I think right now a 9/10 is sufficient. I can imagine giving it a 10, especially when I think of how polished and stupidly playable this game is, but there is something about roguelikes that niggles at me still.

Still, 9/10 it is.\\r', ' ', \"This one of the most compulsive, lavish, complete and stylish indie games ever. The score is really irrelevant.

However, although there's tons of dialogue that reacts to a surprising number of specific situations, the narrative as a whole is puddle deep. It's aimed squarely at pre-teens, and while its borrowing of Greek myth is thorough, it's content with merely referencing things to make its audience feel smart. Anything it has to say about the mythology is expressed more so in their artistic vision of the characters, rather than the character/story arcs - with a couple exceptions.\\r\", ' ', 'Very minor insignificant spoilers in this paragraph:\\r', 'For example the story of Achilles and Patroclus is given a lot of attention (Achilles is an NPC and friend of the player-character), and it amounts to Patroclus moping around all day in Elysium because he misses Achilles, his lover.

It's only in the 20th century that college profs practicing revisionist history have strongly pushed for the idea that there is a hidden homosexual relationship between those characters.

To me that leaves the only purpose for its existence is to send a message. And this is just one major example.\\r\", ' ', \"So without going into endless detail about all of that, in which case I should rather just make a youtube analysis or something, I just wanted to give that short explanation of why the game is subversive - because it is.

It's honestly frightening. This is coming from people who want you to think that Achilles and Patroclus were homosexuals and make it a central plot of their game, yet they're avoiding any depiction of a human breast drawn with a round line (and that's not an exaggeration).\\r\", ' ', \"And for those who will say it's not important and the game should only be judged for its gameplay, I disagree because it's clearly important to Supergiant games.

Yet the chaotic fast paced shooting quickly becomes complex and methodical. Every simple idea gets compounded one, after another, after another, each is explained but it takes the entire campaign to truly understand the mechanics that are given to you. The game is brilliantly paced. Abilities you learned at earlier levels you find yourself using more and more with other abilities later in game, finding synergies amongst your equipment. The game gives exponentially more options, making each combat encounter having thousands to millions of ways to approach. Whether going for a weak point on a big enemy, or ridding a entire area of smaller ones, the gameplay keeps the interactions between you and demons interesting with the game giving you so many ways to approach, you truly adapt to the game and learn it through and through.\\r', 'Design\\r', 'The Design of the game is made to be fast,. The faster you are the less likely you are you get trapped or hit. This incentivisation of quick reaction gameplay keeps the player on their toes. The genius decision by the Devs to give every enemy you encounter a certain weakness makes switching your arsenal frequent and engaging. The gameplay keeps itself fresh as you constantly have to change your approach from demon to demon. The designs of the different enemies are distinct, and with how fast you move, a glance and you know what is over in that direction. Every enemy is engaging, with all of them having attacks which you can take advantage of, and each one being fun to engage with in combat. (except for one, we will get there)\\r', 'Lore\\r', 'For having no story, the game has surprising amounts of lore, which can be accessed at any time through the pause menu. The amount of lore you have depends on where you are in the game. I found this system enhanced the experience, and made the game an interesting story experience as well as a gameplay one which doesn’t intrude on repeat play-thrus, which I feel is the perfect balance between the two concepts.\\r', \"Multiplayer: The multiplayer, After the feedback from the first game (Doom (2016)) that the death match mechanics did not match the original game, the developers created one, if not the most creative multiplayer experiences to date. It’s a 1 V 2, with the one being the Doom Slayer himself. The other two being two of the tougher demons, which can spawn underlines, which effectively make an ever adapting assault against the doom slayer in a quick matched arena battle. The multiplayer does have a few glitches to do with the demons being pushed out of the map when spawning, but shortly after they are transported back to their spawn, this can be jarring, but isn't game breaking.\\r\", 'Flaws\\r', 'The game does come with previously mentioned bugs. I ran into a soft lock, as well as some overly hard to get to collectibles, but other then that, the biggest flaw comes in the form of the enemy which stops the game in its tracks every time they appear, causing the player to stand still and simply wait for them to attack, this is The Marauder.\\r', 'Marauder: Unlike all of the other demons, this one can not be killed normally. Whenever it is shot it will resist any damage by pulling up a shield, the marauder can not be faked out or tricked, they will never miss a block. If you get too aggressive and get to close the Marauder attacks instantaneously. If you are too far away they throw projectiles and adds, And the middle ground seems to fluctuate wildly. (which is the only time the Marauder will be able to be hit) The only time you can attack is then the Marauder does their axe attack, which draws the entire game to a halt because it’s random if the marauder is going to. The Marauder is the most annoying part of the game, and is by far the most flawed. (The funny thing is, Marauders are playable in multiplayer, and are fixed. They don’t have shields, and their best defense is movement, meaning you have to predict where they are going to be, which in turn, keeps the Marauder engaging to fight unlike in the actual game.)\\r', 'OverAll I enjoyed my time with  immensely, it’s a strong 9/10 , with the down moments being frustrating, but the highs being so energetic and befitting for one of the best games of the year.']\n",

You can actively play with 3 friends can load into the game any time you want from any safegame. Everyone plays their own character and can walk the world, while every interaction has meaning in its own way. So other players can actively screw you if they so desire and at times they will without wanting to do so.\\r', '(Been playing with 2 friends for now 40 hours and still going strong)\\r', ' ', \"-They choices in this game are far reaching and meaningful, so you can actively meet people you saved earlier or some people might be angry at you for killing someone. You can act like a douche or a savoir, but most questgivers offer choices which go more into moral grey areas. This in itself is a great thing to do in every RPG, at least in my opinion. EVERY CHOICE HAS MEANING. It's like a real world with real people in it. It's a loveletter to everyone who likes Baldurs Gate 2 or even Planescape: Torment. Still the replayability in this game is through the roof. You can play this game 5 times and not see every choice you can make.\\r\", ' ', \"-The Story is superior to the Original SIn 1, which in itself isn't all that hard to achieve but this time they actually made more of an effort to engage you in the story. It starts with you not knowing what's going on at all, but after some time it gains traction and becomes pretty engaging, which is partly due to the great voice acting. Everything in this game is voiced, which is itself is an achievement in itself. There are about 84000 voicelines in this game, which is absolutely staggering. This time around you feel a lot more important in the story and more epic overall. Plus the cutscenes have some of the beautiful art you can get in Video games.\\r\", ' ', \"The turn based battle system feels honed and intuitive. Every skilltree is viable and adds to your character in a meaningful way. Want to be Necromancer, Summoner? You can be and it's strong tree to actually invest to. Want to be a mage?

In fact, I have quite a few issues with this game.\\r\", \"But first I'll start with what I liked.  The environment is beautiful and fun to explore.  Exploration and the discovery of secrets was the best part of the game for me.  The unique characters provided are fun and interesting and each has unique skills that make basic remedial task of the game easier.  Like the skeleton being able to switch to any race or the lizard being able to dig up treasure.   The dialog trees are deep and thorough and involve many skills and abilities to advance in dialog which is cool.  The voice acting is also great and adds to the believability of these characters. Your max party size is 4, and with 6 total unique characters each play through will be different.\\r\", 'Speaking of party size, I found the max size small compared to type of opposition you will face in the game.  I though it would increase over the game but after 50 hours of play, it did not.  You will nearly always be fighting enemies far numerous than you and most will also be of an equivalent or higher level.  The old trick of doing every extra mission to advanced further in experience by later levels didn’t seem to work very well in this game.  At least that’s what I noticed by level 8 or 9.  Even enemies of equal levels have far more hit points and armor than any of your character could have at a similar level.  Well, it seems I’ve moved into the bad territory so here goes…\\r', 'The major problem I have with this game is the main problem I had with X-Com 2.  It takes a game that should mostly be tactical and destroys any tactics you might have.  Think you can take your fighter tank to pin down a couple melee fighters so your range attacker can shoot from afar?  Nope.  Every enemy has some type of teleportation effect that can move to your archer or magic user unimpeded.  Even by level 3.  It’s funny because I mention classes but there are not really any major class differences in this game.  Every character can multi-class so every fighter can use range attacks, area of attacks, teleport and so on.  When everyone is special no one is special.  Bu-bye classes.\\r', 'The addition of destructible and dynamic battlefields is, at first, genius but it is taken way too far in this game.  I liked how the game made use of seemingly trivial elemental effects, like rain and fog to change the battlefield.  But when barrels of fire and oil are literally everywhere on the map (like in the middle of a forest), and every single range spell also has an area of effect, the battlefield gets littered with so much damage-over-time debris that each character can’t take a step without taking more damage.  It’s pretty laughable at times.  I guess that’s why there are so many teleport abilities, especially for enemies.\\r', 'This game doesn’t start out on level 1 and work to 20.  It starts out at level 10 and calls it level 1 or 2.  You are almost immediately introduced to resurrection scrolls and a way to craft them.  That’s how often party members will be dying so there really is no penalty for it.  A party member death should be a big deal in a game so devoted to story like this but it is treated as trivial and common place.  Also, most spells do large amounts of area damage over time.  Long gone are the days of level 1 magic missile being simple direct damage.\\r', 'You can screw up a build so bad for a character that they are almost unplayable.  That’s why respecs are free by the end of the first act.  A sign of poor design, in my opinion.

The isometric view might not be everyone's cup of tea, and before playing the Divinity Original Sin, neither was mine, once you get past the view you start appreciating game even more. It's beautiful in terms of graphics as far as these kind of games are considered, not something ultra realistic, but very much true to being a fantasy world. This year they introduced origin characters, which have their own personal missions, it's nice additions on top of the first game's follower quests. Its a shame only 4 of  6 could be there after act 1, so gives some sort of replay ability in terms of followers alone and there's the standard replay ability of main quest itself based on your actions, also depending on who you are as a main character out of the 6 origin characters, the dialogues and world interactions differ, which is very nice. There's also option to create generic main character to your liking but frankly speaking it's really not required these 6 characters cover every base. The combat is an improvement over the predecessor, the additional focus on source and some interesting elf mechanic of reliving the final moment of the dead is refreshing albeit the way this is achieved is a bit gross :P\\r\", ' ', 'The choices ar meaningful and have big impact on the gameplay. some of the dialogue choice leads to combat killing important NPCs gives more weight to the choices. the turn based combat is encouraging for cross class combos, allows you to plan the combat carefully.\\r', ' ', 'Main story is very good from the get go, you feel a bit lost initially if you are not familiar to the lore but game does keep notes about important things in the world as part of journal entries.\\r', ' ', \"A nice thing and not related to game itself but very important thing in the era of EA and ubisoft madness is there is practically no DRM. Its nice to have developers like Larian and CD Projekt Red in the era of profiteering at the expense of consumer interest and bad PC ports. Wish Devs understand that most pirates won't be their buyers if there's aggressive DRM that's not easily crackable, only small portion of them would buy that game, otherwise Witcher 3 would not have sold in millions. If a game is well made a lot of people will buy it. So there is more to gain by making a solid game than deploying a solid DRM on top of an average game. A DRM in the end consumes same resources that the game is running on and will always have a performance impact the more complicated it gets. so yeah you might gain 10-15% additional sales but if the game were better these numbers could turn into multiple times.\"]\n",

Additionally, dialogues are well-written - you are never forced to choose between breaking character and saying something stupid.\\r', ' ', \"- The new physical/magical armor mechanic adds lots of depth to the combat system. D:OS1 was lacking in terms of depth because it was way too easy to cheese encounters by stacking initiative, summons and crowd control abilities.

These bugs themselves were usually quite minor, but having to run into them on occasion certainly dampened the experience.\\r\", ' ', 'The UI itself is my other big criticism of Divinity, and pretty much mirrors the complaints I had from the first game with not much improved inventory management, and the annoying auto-addition of items to the hotbar. The UI could be more user-friendly with a dedicated tab for quest items, and the ability to customise and rename backpacks for easier sorting. I also feel like there could be better use of screen space, with certain UI screens made larger to minimise the level of scrolling and to read off information more easily. Tooltips, especially for skills also need to be expanded and made more informative.\\r', ' ', 'With regards to the quality of the narrative, characters and overall writing, my impressions are fairly average. The story is perfectly functional but characterization and the general depth of the writing feels a bit flat and lacking in complexity or any strong themes compared to other modern cRPGS.\\r', ' ', 'Overall rating - 8.2/10']\n",

One of the defining games of my childhood and well deserving of this re-release.\\r\", ' ', 'Originally released in 1998, this take on Battlezone was itself a re-imagining of the 1980 arcade game. It blended first-person vehicular combat with real-time strategy elements to create a revolutionary hybrid game experience that has only been briefly revisited since, in games such as Sacrifice and Brutal Legend.\\r', ' ', 'In 1952, as the story goes, a meteor shower in the arctic circle brought a previously unknown organic material to Earth. Simultaneously discovered by scientists of both the US and the Soviet Union, this \"Bio-Metal\" was soon discovered to have the unique ability to remember shapes it had previously assumed. From this material, the superpowers created hovering tanks and weapons centuries ahead of anything they could have otherwise made at the time. They quickly ran out of it, and turned their eyes towards the stars in search of more. In secret, the two nations sent thousand-man armies into space. Thus began a new, hidden chapter of the Cold War- the one too brutal to televise. You will journey into space in search of the bio-metal, and the truth of its origins.\\r', ' ', \"You take the role of a soldier of either the Americans' National Space Defense Force, or NSDF, or the Russians' Cosmo Colonist Army, or CCA. You begin most campaign missions, as well as multiplayer strategy matches, with your own tank and a Recycler- at once your core base structure, your resource depository, and a factory that produces all other essential units. It exists in a mobile or deployed state, able to travel (slowly) about until you find a geyser over which to deploy it, whereupon it becomes able to build. You have two resources: scrap, and pilots. The former are gathered by scavengers, autonomous resource-harvesting vehicles built from the Recycler that will wander the map gathering bio-metal scrap, found lying around in fields on most maps, or generated from destroyed vehicles and structures. Controlling these scrap fields and assigning escorts to your scavengers is crucial in more difficult missions, and in multiplayer.\\r\", ' ', 'Aside from the two story campaigns, there are a variety of multiplayer modes, including deathmatch, strategy, and \"MPI\", a form of co-op strategy versus AI. This Redux includes extensive Steam Workshop support- you can download maps on the fly even in-game. It also includes updated models and visual effects, trading cards, achievements, and other niceties- aside from running very smoothly on modern systems, more so then it ever did in the old days. However, it is a essentially a straight re-release, and does not attempt to address any of the game\\'s existing shortcomings- save the netcode, of course.\\r', ' ', \"You are limited, for example, to only ten units of each type, since that's as far as the number keys go, as well as the hard pilot cap of 30. The AI is single-minded at best and suicidal at worst, with frequent issues with pathfinding, often getting stuck trying to scale inclines the player would have no trouble at all with. Scavengers are completely incapable of not only defending themselves but even of reacting to being attacked, and will continue on their merry way scavenging in the face of certain destruction. Artillery units will fire at will regardless of the risk of hitting your own forces and cannot be set to hold their fire. Your offensive units also require careful management ot get the most out of their attacks. The walkers are also so painfully slow that their use in most campaign missions is extremely limited- its entirely possible to finish CCA Mission 6, for example, without the use of the three Golems you are given. Most campaign missions also have only one or two safe methods of completion, with very little room for experimental tactics.\\r\", ' ', 'However, most of these flaws are attributable to the limitations of the original game engine, and and while they are even more glaringly obvious all these years later, there is something to be said for bringing the game to Steam and a new audience as is, the way we enjoyed it 18 years ago, and it is certainly easier to forgive then a brand new game with these same flaws. Battlezone was something completely new and any problems it had were excusable in the face of how much fun I had with it, and it was a great pleasure to revisit this landmark title in both my young life and the history of PC gaming.

            "Final Fantasy IX [\"Final Fantasy IX was a game that was highly, and I do mean highly, recommended to me by friends and family. Now, Final Fantasy is a series that I hold in very high regard. FFVI and FFVII are both some of the greatest games that I've ever played, VI especially. So after hearing all of the hype that FFIX seems to get, I expected the game to live up to VI and VII in terms of quality. After all, many people consider this one to be the best in the series. After completing it, I was left...disappointed. Now, I don't think FFIX is a bad game, not at all actually, but it simply didn't live up to the hype that it seems to garner, at least in my opinion. Some parts of the game, like the Festival of the Hunt, Terra, Tetra Master, and the whole ending sequence, are amazing. Truly some of the best content in the series. However, the majority of the game, I'd say around 60% of it, just drags on forever. It's simply not fun to go from point A to point B to point C to point D for 20 hours. I'd be more forgiving if the gameplay was interesting, but it's really not. The entire middle section of the game is just a slog to get through. In fact, I'd say that the game peaks during Disc 1. Not to say that Discs 2-4 are bad, but they're just not very fun. If I can give the game anything, it's that the characters are seriously great. A couple of them feel a bit half-baked, like Freya or Amarant, but characters like Vivi, Steiner, and Zidane, are some of the best that the series has ever seen. Oh, and the ending is amazing as well, easily the highlight of the entire game. I don't think it fully makes up for how boring the majority of this game is, but it does end it on a high note. A VERY high note, actually. Overall, I can say that I enjoyed FFIX, just not nearly as much as I thought I would. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as VI or VII, but I'd put it about on the same level as FFIV. Though most of this game is monotonous and slow, there are enough really great moments that elevate the game above average. If only slightly so.\"]\n",

I've never played a game like this before, but my girlfriend loved Harvest Moon back in the day and we are both are in love with this game.  It is one of the first games we've ever played where we can both play.  Are growing farm has 1 of each animal, all given nicknames very personal.  A goat that has a combination of my in-laws names for his own.  A pig named Porkins in honor of the Star Wars character, because why not!?!?\\r\", ' ', \"Being able to give personal names to these animals, your child, your farm, etc. Make the property and assets you own in the game feel like your own, you're more invested.\\r\", ' ', \"The gameplay loop is satisfyingly addictive, and there's a lot of flexibility in how you can play the game.  My first play through was mostly focused on a moderate amount of farming, lots and lots of foraging, mining, and fishing to make a little extra income so I could gradually level up my tools.  My second play through was noticeably different. Focusing heavily on crops and saving up to buy next season's crops in bulk, I was usually so tired after watering all of the crops, I usually didn't have enough energy to fish, mine, or cut down trees.  My time was then spent putting more focus into befriending people (because it doesn't use energy, the game's version of stamina.) and I have the excess crops to afford that kind of generosity.  It pays off though.  The recipes and perks of being good friends with your neighbors allows you to learn new recipes for food that can restore that crucial energy meter, or they can send you the odd gift like useful supplies for the farm.  Those are two different play-throughs with two very different consequences.\\r\", ' ', \"Want to do nothing while your farm makes it's own money?  Craft 3 dozen bee boxes and let them generate $100 (or even more if you place them near flowers) per bee box every 4 hours.  Want to be the country's largest producer of pumpkins?  Use every square inch of your farm to plant 2600 pumpkins... Have fun watering them every day.  Or you can become a spelunker and dig down into the mines and try and collect as many minerals and resources as you can get.  There are many ways to make money in this game.  That freedom is yours to decide.\\r\", ' ', \"Controls are a mixed bag with a gamepad, I've had a few head slapping moments where seeds, walls, floors, fertilizer were placed somewhere they shouldn't have been. Does it affect the gameplay much?  No, it doesn't.  But when it does happen, 1 or twice every few hours of gameplay, it reminds me that a keyboard and mouse is the best way to play this game.  But if you're a gamepad gamer like myself, don't be dissuaded to ignore this game.\\r\", ' ', \"The game mostly functions well, I have come across a few glitches in the game, but most of those have been resolved by a dedicated 1-man developer who's interacted with the booming fanbase of a game that he passionately made on his own within 4.

            "Stardew Valley ['In recent years, the Harvest Moon series has died down some over the course of several new games, where the next one does not really add anything new to the last. Until now, the only alternative to the series has mostly been Rune Factory, which is also a very good series. This game, however takes the good from both series and breathes new life into the formula.\\r', ' ', 'It has many elements that any player of either series would be more than familiar with: farming crops, raising livestock, fishing, and mining. And everything is timed with the daily clock and monthly calendar dates, with special events happening every so often. These categories work the same way as their inspirations for the most part, however there are some key differences. A big over-arching change is that your farmland is almost completely customizable. Other than your house, there is nothing that is pre-placed, and your land area is gigantic. This allows for a fully customized farm that is unique to you. Fishing has a minigame instead of automatically catching whatever you hook; at first, the minigame is extremely difficult, but it does not take long to get used to. Farming also comes with conveniences that never existed before, such as upgradable sprinklers that water tiles of your crops for you (the amount depends on the level of sprinkler) as well as several kinds of fertilizers that have different effects on your crop. Raising animals is mostly the same, however the range of animals that you can care for is vast, including chickens, ducks, goats, pigs, and cows. All of these areas of the game work well, and as one would expect, with there being plenty of variety in all three. Any of these elements can be completely ignored if desired and the player can still make a profit. There is no rush to get to anything at a certain time (for the most part) and the game can be played at your own pace.\\r', ' ', \"Mining can be best described as a combination of Rune Factory's combat and Harvest Moon's cave systems. Each floor has a ladder that needs to be found to move on to the next floor, with there being better ore, minerals, gems, etc to mine the deeper you go. Inside the mine are various monsters that can be killed, sometimes even required to kill. The combat is simple, where LMB swings your melee weapon, holding LMB charges up a slingshot, and RMB does various special actions depending on the weapon. However, the simplicity works for the game, as you are always on the clock, and if it were too complex there'd be too much time spent fighting. There is something special at the very bottom of the mine, giving even more reason to explore it.\\r\", ' ', 'Of course, a Harvest Moon inspired game would not be complete without interactions with the townsfolk. The system is the same as it is in Harvest Moon, where you can talk with villagers and give them gifts to get them to like you more. Unlike Harvest Moon, you can only give two gifts per week, meaning the progression of affection is a lot slower unless you complete quests or special interactions with each villager. So long as you give the right gifts and complete the special tasks, it still will not take too long before your chosen bachelor or bachelorette can be married.\\r', ' ', 'Despite everything the game does right, there are some issues with it. The running speed is atrociously slow, especially with diagonal movement. You do eventually unlock a horse, but the horse only speeds up diagonal movement; the vertical and horizontal run speeds remain the same. In addition, the bachelors and bachelorettes vary from each other with personality, however they are fairly two dimensional with their personalities. The developer also apparently had a stroke at one point because if you look at the progression of their appearances, there is a point where they gradually become worse and more same-faced, losing some uniqueness to them. There is also a very unfitting anti-corporation message in the game that could have been left out. The overall graphics style is up to personal preference, but I personally like it and think it does a good job creating the comfy atmosphere these games are known for.\\r', ' ', 'Lastly, the game is capable of being fully modified due to how simple the engine is made. Every pixel can be changed, and mod tools are in the process of being created to add extra content. There is already a mod that changes the appearances of the bachelorettes to an earlier time, as a result of many individuals wanting them altered. So who knows what the developer and modders will add to the game in the future.\\r', ' ', \"In conclusion, this game has just as much if not more content than any of the more modern Harvest Moon games yet is half the price. There are some aspects that I did not even mention such as the sewer dungeon and what is basically the Harvest Sprite tasks because I am 18 hours in and still haven't finished either of those things, nor have I seen everything the game has to offer yet.

The game is simple enough to learn and play and makes an excellent game for couples to play alongside each other as the game was easily picked up and played by my non-gamer girlfriend with minimal problems.\\r', ' ', 'The player starts as a farmer with basic tools and an overgrown farm in a small run-down house.  From the beginning, the player is tasked with restoring the farm to its former glory, but how the player accomplishes this is up to them.  They can clear land and plant crops to sell at a profit, build barns and coops to raise animals to sell their eggs and milk for a profit.  They can fish.  They can mine.  They can adventure.  Stardew Valley empowers the player to go at their own pace and do what interests them.  There is no real \"correct\" way to play the game.  There is a simple fun in experiencing milestones, whether that is leveling up a skill to earn a perk, upgrading a tool for increased inefficiency, or watching as the villagers become more friendly with you.\\r', ' ', 'Players can become friends with townsfolk, learn their backgrounds (Some of which are incredibly well-written emotional stories), and even date and marry the man/woman they desire.

            "Cities: Skylines ['After 2013’s debacle that was Sim City it was time some new devs stepped to the table. Cities XXL was a huge miss as Focus Interactive did nothing to improve their terrible running and clunky game so the question is, did Colossal Order (a Paradox dev responsible for Cities in Motion) deliver? Yes, oh my god Yes!\\r', ' ', 'Cities Skylines is another game in the long list of city building and managing simulators that have been trying to succeed in the shoes of what was Sim City 4; released more than 12 years ago. From the dev that created Cities in Motion, Colossal Order does something that no other city sim has done and make a truly great game that brings back the feel of Sim City 4 and my favorite of the series, Sim City 3000. They brought it back to its basics which included zones, different building types like electrical, water, fire, police, medical, fun and even the unique landmark buildings.\\r', ' ', 'When you start creating your city you start in a small 2km x 2km square that can expand as your city gets bigger and you annex other areas to a possible 25 tile, 100km2 area (with the support of a mod that is already in the steam workshop). The game also locks different building, zones, etc. behind population goals so that it isn’t too overwhelming however there are mods that allow you to unlock everything to start if you wish along with unlimited money. The game will also allow for steam workshop when it releases for people to create their own user content to add to the game which could include more buildings, new modes, user made cities and much more.\\r', ' ', 'Along with the buildings and zones there are also the financial and policies that make a city sim a true city sim. They are simple enough and not as annoying as was the advisors in sim city 3000 but they change things greatly including outlawing private traffic in certain zones forcing people to take mass transit instead. What those policies and other specific buildings do is increase the happiness of the people in the commercial, residential and industrial zones. As your happiness increases they are more likely to accept higher taxes and recommend more people to move in causing an increase in desire for residential and other financial zones. I can also say that Colossal Order certainly know how to make their transport lines work and work well because every form of transportation was easy to create and maintain.\\r', ' ', 'That being said the roads themselves were difficult to make sure they were right especially having off ramps connect to highways. When I bought my first annex there was a highway running through it. I thought it would have been easy enough to figure out how to implement a overpass/rounded off ramp to have access to the other side of the highway however I had to do a lot of work to get a new one working. First I had to delete the existing off ramps and highway to make way for a 4 way off ramp. On top of that in order to make sure a one way road/highway continues to go one way, instead of detecting which way automatically the roads go you to build the road in the same direction traffic would flow. Took me about 15 minutes to realize this. Hopefully it’ll be something they patch after release because I can imagine it’ll be something some people will complain about.\\r', ' ', 'One other complaint, and maybe it is something I’m not used to due to the simplicity of zones in Sim City 3000, I don’t like the way zones sit for  “squares” off the road for each road you make. I’m more of a fan of dragging and dropping to make a zone like it was in SC 3000. That is just a personal preference. However all you can do with the roads is quite impressive and though I did play this game quite a bit I wasn’t able to play it enough to truly design a city that looked great.\\r', ' ', 'Now this game looks quite impressive and the buildings are quite varied enough to make the cities and areas look unique. Mod support and steam workshop is only going to improve the variety of buildings after release. The engine runs smooth, however capped at 60 fps (not that you really need more since this isn’t a action moving game), and looks great. The UI is clean and they actually made a change to it as I was playing my review copy in the last week.\\r', ' ', 'The sound isn’t anything spectacular, however it is there and does work well with what the game is. If you zoom in to roads you can hear cars going by, if you do the same for various areas you hear what you would expect to hear if you were walking on the street. The ambient music also makes it nice to listen to while you are designing away. So nothing over the top but fits quite well.\\r', ' ', 'Overall, Cities Skylines, I feel, is truly the best city sim game since Sim City 4 and in fact is better than 4. It has everything that you could want in a city building game; large building areas, variety in design and buildings, unique challenges in building and managing and a great looking engine.']\n",

            "Cities: Skylines ['Cities: Skylines is barely a decent game. Comparatively EA’s 2013 Sim City was a disaster, and that’s one reason Cities has done so well. However, I don’t think it will replace Sim City 4 Deluxe on my shelf anytime soon. Cities has a solid foundation, but its limitations are glaring. Without mod support and DLC, Cities is an average experience with no innovation.\\r', ' ', 'Cities looks fantastic and runs smoothly. While zoomed in, I see bustling sidewalks and speedy cars zipping around my tidy neighborhoods. There’s enough detail to feel immersive, but not so much as to overwhelm older (or weaker) hardware. Load times can be a bit long tho. At first, city building is not all that different from Sim City. Players need to connect to an external highway, build roads, run utilities, designate zones, and watch as their cities come to life. Once populations reach certain points, players get access to more buildings and services. Each citizen has a name, address, education level, age etc. Players can select an icon above a citizen or car to automatically follow them around.\\r', ' ', 'Unfortunately, once towns hit 30,000 or so citizens, Cities’ shortcomings become apparent. Foremost, Cities lacks variety. All buildings look similar. Players can’t build space centers or towering skyscrapers. No army bases or national parks. No private schools or hockey rinks. Towns look generic. Players can’t micromanage stats either. Socioeconomic policies are rudimentary and have negligible impact. Tax revenues are too generous. City building merely entails constructing some roads and zoning for residential and business. That’s about it. What a startling lack of innovation. Cities is so featureless that players debate its merits over Sim City 4, a game which launched 12 years earlier.\\r', ' ', 'Town services are horrid. Landfills pile up insanely quick. There’s no sewage processing, so all sewage is pumped directly into waterways that become polluted within a few hours of play. Creative players will find ways around this. I’ve used in game assets to create my own sewage processing facility (no mods), but doing that ate up massive swaths of valuable real estate and tax revenues. Power stations are anemic. At early levels, the better stations are heavy polluters and resource hungry. And even little towns will need multiple stations or acres of wind turbines. Players will need to build dozens of cemeteries, police/fire stations, schools to service relatively small footprints. Players can’t connect multiple towns together. That was a fan favorite feature in Sim City. So each town must be self-sufficient. The game automatically exports/imports goods to and from imaginary neighboring towns. Players can’t arrange trade agreements. Cities tries to offset this limitation by providing players a larger sandbox. But it’s just not the same as linking a mining town to a farming community or a suburb to a technology hub.\\r', ' ', 'As towns grow larger, Cities devolves into a traffic manager simulation. Unexperienced players will likely rage over this. The Cities’ AI is laughably stupid. Vehicles always travel the shortest route regardless of obstructions or traffic. By default, they will not take detours or travel alternate routes. I’ve seen dozens of big rigs pile up on a dirt road but ignore a 6 lane highway one red light away because the route was 1 or 2 miles longer. Bus stops can have a dozen or more buses piled up and blocking traffic for 10 blocks. Train stations, docks, and airports will be flooded with unbearable congestion. The worst part about traffic is how early it wrecks towns. New players will need to commit hours of trial and error to fix traffic problems in even the smallest, most basic towns. Not managing traffic will shut towns down completely. Businesses won’t receive deliveries. Power plants won’t receive fuel.\\r', ' ', 'Traffic can be managed, but not effectively. I’ve built towns with 300,000+ citizens and spent half my time rerouting roads. The process resulted in the destruction of meticulously zoned sections. Without mods, traffic is helplessly broken even with the latest DLC.\\r', ' ', 'Players can’t send tornadoes ripping the suburbs nor can they summon earthquakes. That requires DLC. Want to see your town at night? DLC. Like snow? DLC. Cities is a barebones package without DLC. Unfortunately, the DLC’s have their own shortcomings. The other deficits—and there are plenty—require mods to fix. Thankfully, the mod community for Cities is robust, and many of its shortcomings are addressed by dedicated fans at no charge. Without those, I wouldn’t be playing Cities at all. Thanks to its fans, Cities can be fun.\\r', ' ', 'Cities: Traffic Manager Simulator should only be purchased on sale. It’s an incomplete package that requires DLC, mods, and tweaking to make it a decent experience. Sim City 4 Deluxe might be showing its age, but it’s considered the gold standard by many gamers for good reason.']\n",

The game seems to be lacking some road functionality, Traffic often takes the same lane on a 3 lane road and this ends up causing huge traffic jams. There\\'s no way to connect a road to another and not have it create an intersection, this is especially annoying when using highway ramps or one way roads. There seems to be a lack of unique buildings. I found this glaring when trying to increase my tourism. Supposedly tourism is supposed to be a big way to get money but there\\'s no real way to draw tourists other than making these big, unlockable, \"unique buildings\" which do nothing other than drawing tourists in very small numbers. There\\'s also no way to terraform the environment. You can\\'t make a hill or level a mountain. This becomes annoying when trying to place a large building because you have to find a place that is totally flat. Airports are my biggest grief with this. Due to the generally bland nature of the maps (almost completely flat with some trees and rivers here or there) all your cities end up looking similar. Citizens seem to die quickly and in waves. No matter how much you\\'re growing you will come across \"death waves\" where hundreds, if not thousands, of your citizens will die within a few days. This is annoying and makes it hard to judge what your true growth is or if you\\'ve come across a serious problem.   I\\'m sure there are more issues I came across but I can\\'t think of them now. Overall the game is enjoyable and I intend on going back to it. The devs seem intent of fixing at least some of these issues and supposedly on releasing a ton of DLC.

The voice acting is great and the characters are awesome. I had a blast playing this game. It feels like R-rated Disney, not that it's goofy, but that it takes well-known fairy-tales and brings them into a dark and gritty world. I highly recommend this game. It solidified my belief that Telltale needs to keep making games, even if they have made some questionable decisions as far as what franchises they should take on.\"]\n",

Caveat, this game contains some nudity, and obviously violence. It's not for a younger audience. Keep in mind too that this is a Tell Tale production. It is considered a game but is closer to being an interactive book. If you're looking for something with a stromg story this could be worth a purchase. It's best played on PC; avoid the Wolf Among Us on the Xbox 360 (as it doesn't work at all).\"]\n",

            "The Wolf Among Us ['With The Wolf Among Us, I had very high expectations. A production of Telltale Games, one of my favorite game publishers (and based in my spiritual home of Marin County, California), the game uses a similar engine and format as The Walking Dead, Season One, one of the best games of recent years. It has a noir setting; draws on the smart comic series, Fables; features similarly breathtaking visuals as The Walking Dead; and stars many of the same excellent voice actors. My mental narrative was an exciting one. It foresaw The Wolf Among Us as a brilliant riff on Western fairy tales and urban legends, holding the Magic Mirror up to these classics and showing us their dark undercurrents.\\r', ' ', 'Expectations can be fatal, however, to the success of a game. The writers behind The Wolf Among Us failed to pull together a coherent story, let alone one as smart and caustically insightful as The Walking Dead.\\r', ' ', \"Up through Season Five, I was quite deeply engaged in the story. My favorite character (other than our hot hero, Bigby Wolf) couldn't be any other than the morally demanding, politically engaged, strong female character of Snow White. In some ways, I consider her one of the best developed characters in video gaming of recent years. She takes charge, but vocalizes her self-doubts; she holds firm to principles of justice in the face of exceptions that have proved the rule for too long in Fabletown. Her back-and-forth with Bigby is compelling, and though predictable her relationship with him satisfyingly deepens over the episodes.\\r\", ' ', \"The climax of the game, though--apparently meant to be a dramatic and epic fight between Bigby and the villain's henchwoman, Bloody Mary--nearly drove me to laughter. Suspension of disbelief may seem strained in a game where pigs complain and moan between draws on their cigarettes, but it wasn't until this climax that I felt the boundary had been broken. This silly turn-of-events made me realize that I had crushed on Snow White and Bigby Wolf so much that I no longer really cared what was going on in the narrative. For an intentionally story-driven game, this isn't a good thing. It not only failed to turn the critical eye on literature that I wanted, but it collapsed inward on its shoddy narrative. Not even the strength of its voice acting, graphics, or gameplay, in my view, can balance out the game's inability to make good on its reason for being: to provide a rich interactive story. My expectations far exceeded what The Wolf Among Us became. As a result, it seems little more than glamour on a pig.\\r\", ' ', \"The magic of this fairy tale thus broken, I sit disappointed. I would recommend The Wolf Among Us for fans of Telltale, of noir, and of interactive stories. But only just. I wish this weren't the case, that it had been as masterfully developed as The Walking Dead.

It may seem like it's a typical detective story, but trust me. With the interesting setting this game is in, it's way more complicated than it first seems. The characters in TWAU are also very nicely done. This was probably the last Telltale game where they actually weren't money-grabbing **** All characters you meet are important to the story and are very developed. There's not a single character that seems pointless. The positive ones do really help you and feel their presence, negative ones are also awesome, makes you feel scared... until the wolf gets angry. Now we get to the absolute bad ass main character - Bigby Wolf. All his forms bring new gameplay elements. First, it's just a man-looking wolf, then he reveals his second form and becomes way more powerful. Though in the final episode, the enemies managed to make him so angry for him to transform to his true form - the Big Bad Wolf. While playing for this character you feel great, you feel like you have a lot of power and you are not afraid of anything. It's a great feeling. Another thing I absolutely love is the soundtrack.

Inspired by the same comic book series name, The Wolf Among Us thrusts us into the paws of Sheriff Bigby Wolf who must keep Fabletown together. Having not read the comics of the same name, this game introduces players wonderfully to the dark, grim, and somewhat satirical nature of old fables struggling to thrive in the modern world. The writing is still top notch, as well as the voice acting and animations that accompany it. What I really enjoyed is the very noir inspired synth soundtrack which really draws much inspiration from 80s crime noir films. The mechanics are much the same with The Walking Dead where you go a about a fixed camera angle inspecting items, making conversation and decision, and when the going gets tough QTEs come into place. Its a well working formula that has succeeded in much of the episodes but along with that came TellTale's biggest flaw: your decisions have little impact whatsoever. It irked me a tad when I read on the top left corner that example character notices something, but fails to see any consequences. Even deciding who lives or dies does not change outcomes or later scenarios, which is a big flaw in a game that promotes player choices.

I absolutely love the gritty world it has created taking well known characters from fables and giving them circumstances and lives in our world that is anything from ideal and is very relatable in many cases. The story was extremely well done and I loved many of the choices you could make and ways you could branch things. I didn’t always like the choice options I had but that is actually a good thing as sometimes you don’t have options that are perfect or good so what I loved was how some of them could make me conflicted. The characters are all pretty well explored and I enjoyed them although I would have loved if Bloody Mary had more time in game. I liked how you could be a more brutal Bigby or show restraint or somewhere in the middle. The graphics are similar to other Tell Tale games which is to save a well done comic style. The voice acting was superb across the board with no characters who I would say was voiced poorly. The music was great and the intro credits to each episode really had a good noir feel to it.\\r', ' ', 'I played The Wolf Among Us on Linux using Wine and DXVK. It crashed once to the desktop but other than that ran great with no other bugs or glitches that I noticed. There are two graphics settings; an AA toggle; and a resolution option. Alt-Tab works.

In The Wolf Among Us, you will play as Bigby, The Big Bad Wolf, trying to keep peace inside the Fabletown as it's Sheriff. One day she met a girl named Faith, and on the same day, Faith was killed and her head was left in front of Bigby's apartment. Who's the killer? and Why? Play the game to the conclusion and you'll get your head blown for it.\\r\", 'Plus point:\\r', \"- After The Walking Dead Season 1, Telltale games made their name known for that masterpiece. And after that, they went and released The Wolf Among Us. When i played the first episode, i was blown. The game is visually beautiful, compared to The Walking Dead, it's totally an upgrade. Kinda like 2D Cell Shading kind of Visual, and it's awesome.\\r\", \"- The story includes characters that are famous and known to us. Like Snow white, Little Red Riding Hood, Humpty & Dumpty, Bloody Mary, & Etc. Although you never read Fable before, the characters are basically from the fairy tale. So, it's not someone that you don't know at all.\\r\", '- Although i must say that the story progress is kinda slow, the conclusion to the game is pretty much awesome. That plot twists are gonna make you nod your head.\\r', '- A much more elaborate battle system. It becomes more similar to Heavy Rain, much more actions you can do, and much more objects that you can interact with. I think this system is an update from The Walking Dead.\\r', 'Minus point:\\r', \"- Unlike The Walking Dead, the choices that you made in the game doesn't really affect your storyline in an extreme way, which is why the options in the game isn't really that important. This game is not about an adventure, it's about solving a case.

The game play was a pretty basic make your own decisions with some reaction button smashing when a fight occurs, it isn't anything that interesting and the so called '' puzzles'' were just there to waste your time. The choices you were making did have some impact on the story and how the world and it's characters react toward you but it didn't really change the overall experience that much, it was also an issue that most of the characters weren't that fleshed out which made it harder for you to like them or even care about them (the walking dead didn't have this issue and it was awesome because you actually kinda empathized with the the main character and the supporting cast). The game also had a couple of bugs but I enjoyed the overall story and the ''twist'' that they showed up in the end, I can say that it did made me at least a bit interested in the Fables comics which this was inspired from so I can say that this is a pretty alright game 8/10\"]\n",

The game is beautifully written, and remains true to Kirkman's universe. It is emotionally gripping, and balances the story expertly between the desolation and intensity of a post-apocalyptic world. The visual design is highly stylized, and creates some wonderful set pieces. I should preface my criticisms by noting that I really enjoying the format of these narrative point-and-click adventures; Some of my early favourites included Myst and the original Monkey Island series. I found that, although immersive and adeptly convincing, my choices often had little effect on the broader outcome of the adventure. The consequences of a poor decision were often minimal and only swapped small pieces of dialogue. This often served to break the experience for me, and I felt as though I wasn't playing a game as much as I was reading a one-shot story arc in the Walking Dead comic book series. The limited puzzle-like content was excruciatingly simple, and felt served up piping hot.\\r\", \"To cut my ramblings short; Wonderful story, a must-play for fans, and nothing I regret spending time on.

And for a bonus I was left with a tear in my eye by the third and fifth chapter. This game must be played by anyone who loves storytelling and amazing dialogues in video game and even movies. What many are complaining about is that there is no gameplay or oh this isn't a game it's an interactive show but they are missing the entire point of the game! It isn't to collect killstreaks or to amaze with set pieces, it's to move your emotional strings and make you care about it's characters! If this isn't your type of game don't play it but this review is for the ones who knew what they were in for. You play as Lee Everett, a man with a shady past who in the midst of a zombie apocalypse finds a lonely little girl, Clementine. The moment you meet her you feel the burden of having to protect her and it doesn't ever go away. There were moments I felt so much sympathy for her or even doubt of myself if I was good enough for her that I felt things only real life could achieve! This is a very dark game, for those who didn't know! You will see a lot of  up things and meet some  up characters (episode 2, holy crap). But you will meet others who will join your group and become friends with you. And by god there will be choices! Choices that matter even from the first episode! And you will disagree even with your best companions in some cases! I repeat this is some intense  and there's gonna e tension in the air. But I can say in the third chapter there was one so strong character development that I shed a TEAR! And of course the final episode I cried, literally cried. And not just in one scene! This game will move you! Even if you are the most stone cold emotionless man in the country. About the gameplay I can say it's point and click and there are tense scenes that require you to press a button really fast or stuff but nothing very gripping. But th strong  is in the dialogue options! You have to think and react fast and believe me there will be a time or two that you will do something you would have never done in any other choice game. Like I said this game requires your emotions and ideas to play, not the ones from the character! So in general if you love good stories and great character development and dialogue you are in for the experience of the year! I'm gonna give it a nine because it doesn't really appeal to everybody!

As an adventure game, it was an absolute flop. The puzzles (if I can even call them that) were not even remotely challenging. In fact, the solution was always given to you (via the cues your mouse overs would give you.) And they never required any effort on the players part to really solve. Also, while you were presented with a lot of choices in the narrative as to what exactly you wanted to do, it's hard to feel like the choices really made any significant difference. I'm almost afraid to give it a second play through just to prove my point further as I feel it would be rather depressing to see how little changes. Now I understand it would be damn near impossible for a developer to make infinite branching possibilities to a game, but there was many times where I could 'guess' where they were trying to lead the plot and was specifically trying to make decisions that would deviate away from that path, but regardless the story would progress down those lines no matter what I said, did, etc. So generally, it felt like I was 'playing' a movie, with light adventure elements and a bit of 'choose your adventure'. In the end, the resultant feeling I got was super 'casual' and so even though I really enjoyed the experience and consider it a memorable experience, I rather get left with the impression it was an awful game.

The storytelling was amazing, the voice acting was great (with the exception of Clementine for me, but perhaps that's how she was supposed to be and it just went over my head), the graphics weren't top-notch but they captured that comic book feel, and the interface was pretty good.  Sometimes I felt the point-and-click quick-time-events were a bit clunky.  Sometimes I was clicking, multiple times, on the designated area, but nothing happened.  Also the lack of free saving during the game and the inability to skip dialogue scenes was a bit irritating.  The game is definitely not action-oriented.  It's all story and character.  But each episode makes you make some very hard decisions and the game takes those choices into account as the world moves on.  Some choices have higher values than others, and you sometimes learn that the hard way, and sometimes the choices you make seem like they would have a bigger impact but then they don't...  That's why I gave the game a 9/10.  Overall, it's an amazing game that deserves some of the highest praise, but there are just a few things that stick out that keep it from being perfect.  It's more inconsistencies than anything...

The graphics are supposed to represent a comic, but i\\'ve seen comics that look better than this game. Some of the textures, especially trees and bushes and the ground, are terrible. And the gameplay, which is the most important part of any game, is boring and sometimes unintuitive. You rarely get something to do, most of the game is watching a cutscene and listening to dialogue. But, when you do get something to do, it\\'s just simply clicking here one to kick a zombie, or some other unimportant thing. It\\'s not fun at all, honestly, i\\'d rather have just watched the game play before me then having to keep my hand on my mouse and wait an see if there is some QTE that pops up. The game also states that the decisions you make affect the game. This is true to a degree, but don\\'t expect to be able to save one person all the way through to the end, or have your decisions greatly affect the ending. There is one ending to the game no matter what you do. The points in the game where you\\'re supposed to pick one thing or another don\\'t have any bearing on what happens in the end, either.

From the start, it's clear that the world of Thedas is an epic place, with conflict, nuances, and thousands of years of history.  Likely you disagree, but don't believe the gamers giving this game a poor score. Beyond being a sublime game, dragon age origins pushes the boundaries of emotion, choice, and freedom within gaming. DAO doesn't simply faithfully receive Baldur's Gate II's mantle of best game out there, it rips that mante from BG2's cold, dead hands, then uses it as a weapon to single handedly enslave every other game in existence.\"]\n",

I believe that this is far and away the most immersive RPG I've ever played. It is also the first RPG that actually made me feel that the choices I made had real consequences. The dialogue options have a lot of variety and at times I find myself wondering what would have happened in response had I chosen something else. The combat system is wonderful, I love the tactics involved. Although the system of pausing and issuing orders makes combat seem almost turn based in complicated situations it also feels more rewarding to me personally after having out matched my opponents on a strategic level. The only real critism I have is that outside of specialization, character customization is a bit limited, there aren't really many important talent trade offs. Any time I make a Tank character it's pretty much going to be the same build or if I make a rogue or archer or healer or mage. I would have liked it more had I been forced to choose talents that would make a more magic oriented tank or more single target oriented damage dealer etc. Maybe I was just looking for a more fleshed out specialization system. Anyway back to how awesome the game is; Dragon Age Origins is definitely a game that I recommend buying even just as a salute to the developers for great game making. Even though I haven't finished the game I already see myself spending hours and hours repeatedly playing it through with different classes and on different difficulties; and even now I feel a bit anxieous that I might finish it too soon and have to dread waiting for a new expansion or sequel.\"]\n",

It is a single player experience that I haven't had since I played Oblivion. While the gameplay is not exactly like that of the Elder Scrolls series, it is close in its theme. I had never played an RPG like this before, because I found the whole concept rather tedious. After my friend saying that he was pretty jazzed about getting this game, I vowed to give it an honest try. By the time I'd finished the origin portion of the game, I was completely hooked. The voice acting is excellent for the most part, and the graphics are pretty good, although the PC version requirements seem to be considerably high for the graphics quality. My son has no trouble with playing it with his dual core AMD CPU, but he has a pretty good graphics card. I guess the best thing I could say about the game, is that I don't want it to end. After playing for more than 50 hours I still have a way to go before finishing my first play through.

Mechanics-wise DA:O is good - combat is tactical and fun, though I still can't figure out how, in 2009 (2011 as of this writing), Bioware STILL hasn't been able to come up with a decent inventory system.

            "Dragon Age: Origins [' Most overrated RPG of the year. The AI is terrible. Left alone, it will either sit around doing nothing, which means you go nowhere if you\\'ve chosen to play a ranged or back-line support class--or else it will rush blindly into enemies, leaving you to perform damage control and clean up behind as it continues to charge forward without pause. If you play on anything above casual difficulty, you\\'ll fight the AI every step of the way and end up having to constantly micromanage your party. The game offers \"tactics\" slots which you can use to assign conditional behavior patterns to NPC teammates, e.g. \"Heal yourself if your health gets below X%,\" yet for some insane reason, you have to spend skill points to unlock these tactics slots. Essentially, you must spend skill points to make the AI slightly less stupid. The tactics also need far more flexibility and generality, e.g. \"Use any debuff skill not on cooldown\" instead of \"Use specific skill X.\" Because of this, the tactics end up being mostly useless on harder difficulty levels and require you to micromanage the team anyway. On top of these gameplay issues, DAO has a ridiculous amount of dialogue, even by Bioware\\'s verbose standards. It\\'s well-written dialogue, for the most part--but it\\'s still redundant jawing. Too much of the narrative is talked about rather than shown in action. This tendency to tell rather than show has been creeping deeper into each successive Bioware game for years, but it feels like DAO finally crossed the line into self-indulgent writing. Ultimately, the game is simply formulaic: it\\'s the same linear, on-rails RPG with the same linear, on-rails dialogue \"choices\" which are supposed to give us the illusion of making moral decisions in tense, finely-shaded conflicts. Bioware has been making this same well- (if over-) written, painstakingly-realized, yet ultimately stultifying and narratively-funneled game for years. While playing, I kept thinking how cinematic the game felt, and how much more I would have enjoyed it as an animated film, or a novel. Dragon Age: Origins is a throwback RPG addled by last-gen gameplay and self-indulgent, tedious writing.']\n",

            "Dragon Age: Origins [' An Incredibly deep story driven game. It will probably not appeal to 2 hardcore RPG audiences. The first are the Diablo/Korean-RPG, grind-fest, fans, as this game has no grinding, enemies never re-spawn, and once you clear an area, that\\'s that. This adds a HUGE additional challenge, as XP points are as valuable as rare items, and leveling must be taken with great care. I hate grinding more than anything in the world, so I loved this \"feature\". The other people who will probably not like this game are the hardcore D&D fans. Much of the nuances of D&D are not in this game, and for me that is welcome. I don\\'t think walking empty fields in games like Oblivion and Fallout 3 is fun, granted that every once and awhile you find a \"cool\" hidden area or side quest, its not worth the time, for some mundane quest with little to nothing to do with the storyline. Every quest in Dragon Age, down to the leveling \"Request Board\" quests, are expertly crafted into the main plot and often branching. No, there are no find the +16 mace in the randomly generated dungeon with the same enemies you have been fighting for the last 120 hours...and I\\'m fine, no I\\'m ecstatic, about that. I play a game to enjoy it, but to complete it in a \"timely\" fashion, so I can move on to the next game. For me, games like Diablo and Neverwinter nights cheaply increased there length with pointless side-quests or by including equally mundane multiplayer, and I don\\'t understand how they can be fun other then by the mind trick they employ, of using a gauged-reward system (similar to what you find with slot machines in a Casino). Dragon Age trims the fat, and while there is plenty to explore, a after-work gamer will still be able to beat it (for the first time) in a month or 2 and probably a month if you want a second go...which for me, is perfect. But don\\'t get me wrong, this isn\\'t halo were you can beat the game with your eyes closed, on the normal difficulty the game is challenging and will require you to think, which I really enjoyed. I logged 45 satisfied hours at my first run, and after beating some of the new games that are out. I will most surely give it another go. 3 major problems though. 1. the DLC sucks, i got all 3 and they were all a waste of money, they are also integrated into the main game so much that you feel almost as if you \"have\" to do them...they are all skip-able. 2. To many pointless NPC interactions, half the time you can give 2 different responses and get the exact same answer, I\\'m not a real \"role-player\" maybe if you are one, this makes the game more \"realistic\" but for me, it was just annoying. 3. The game has memory leaks, if you sit for a long session the loading times get longer and longer and longer, this is fixed by a restart of the game, but an annoying problem never-the-less Highly Recommend for any normal gamer like me, who enjoys a well thought out, well put together game for (I can\\'t after reading the other reviews on here emphasize this enough) NORMAL people.']\n",

            "Dragon Age: Origins [' I tend to review games I play once I\\'ve played about 50% the way through. I reserved my judgement on DAO until I completed it. The first thing i\\'d say is that this game is definately the best RPG on release at this moment. With a few more games coming out here in 2010, fans of this genre are in for some good times, and if you haven\\'t yet played this game then you really should. Graphically, if you have a high end card and a halfway decent CPU then you are in for a visual treat. I played 50% of this game on an 8800gtx and the last 50% on an ATI 5870. The difference between the two allowed me to max out my screen at 1920x1200 and also max out all the settings in-game and whack on some AA. The game looked amazing. Not to say the ageing 8800 couldn\\'t handle it, because it could, but I had to play it in 1680x1050 and lower some of the settings. The game has a main storyline which is a bit Lord of the Rings, but without the rings, and the mass of orcs replaced by Darkspawn, which in essence are the same kind of thing, basically marauding humanoids hellbent on wiping out humanity, which is kind of ironic. To achieve your goals you will have to take part in a series of subplots, which in themselves are rather epic in scale. Tie this in with a large dose of sidequests and you will soon find yourself overwhelmed with quests in your log. So, where does DAO drop from a 10 to a 9? Well, as i\\'m sure others have mentioned, sometimes the sidequests are very \"chorelike\" and you can find yourself quickly being taken away from the main objectives you want to achieve for large chunks of time. If you become addicted to the game and play for 5-6 hours solid per session, you could end up sporadically feeling that you haven\\'t achieved much in the session. I myself, played some days like that, and other days I would play for an hour or two, and some days I\\'d leave it alone completely. When coming back to it, I would feel refreshed and ready to plough on. As for difficulty, playing the game on it\\'s default level is a real challenge for many players i\\'m sure. Being an old timer myself, and having played too many RPG\\'s to list, I found the challenge on the default setting just right. I died in places I expected to once stepping into a fight I knew were going to require a learning curve to beat, and once beat, I felt a real sense of achievement. Fortunately the combat mechanics in DAO are very well implemented. The tactics you can give to your team are in depth, and the game provides easy to use setups should you not want to spend time mastering your own tactics for each character. The game comes with DLC that you can purchase for a reasonable cost, and if you didn\\'t get the deluxe version that comes with most of it, then buying it is definately something you want to do, especially Soldier\\'s Peak which provides you with a chest for storage. From start to finish, Dragon Age Origins is a masterpiece on the PC. It has very few technical issues (at least on my machine), and plays smoothly. A definate recommendation.']\n",

What technical glitches or loading screens that annoy the player is more than compensated for by the characters the PC encounters and the emotions they can draw from him/her. These emotions are what Molyneaux, of the Fable franchise, tried to coax out of the players, but failed to do so. Dragon Age makes you care for your companions, who get mad at you for doing something stupid and who may develop change-of-hearts due to you nourishing your relationships with. This is what role-playing should be able to do: make you care for the people you meet and the world you are in. Of course, you can also choose not care. You can frustrate your companions, anger them until some are forced to draw their weapons against you. You can damn the world by electing poor leaders, or massacring groups of people, or dooming souls for your benefit. That is something this game does well, the element of role-playing. In the end, as far as the year has gone, no other game executes the same element as well as Dragon Age does. That\\'s why there is no denying it is the best 2009 has to offer in RPGs, even the naysayers and flamers have no coherent argument to the contrary.']\n",

            "Dragon Age: Origins [\" I think its important to put the game into the proper context. To contest some of the negative user reviews and forewarn potential buyers, you're not buying something akin to Diablo or The Elder Scrolls here. Dragon Age follows the tradition of relatively linear, but well told role playing adventures like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, etc. Be prepared for a complex story and great character development (in terms of loot, stats, and stories), not a big free-roaming world or endless waves of monsters to click on. There are plenty of side quests and places to wander off the beaten path, but the game generally keeps you focused on the central plot. With that in mind, Dragon Age is a truly epic game. Bioware have gone from developing excellent games in other people's universes to producing equally excellent titles with completely new worlds to support them. If you can stomach some serious micromanaging and almost as much dialogue as gameplay, don't pass this title up. Its the best RPG I've played since... well... the last Bioware title.\"]\n",

            "Dragon Age: Origins [\" One thing is pretty clear to me after reading most of the user reviews in which the score given was 4 or under; the person doing the reviewing in most cases wanted a simple MMO, or a hack-n-slash no brainer, and has no idea what goes into making an RPG deep and meaningful. Nor do they have any idea of what it means to be objective as a reviewer, which really has nothing to do with whether or not the game suits your personal tastes, yet none of these mmo and/or console generation fanboys seem to understand that simple concept. The fact is that Dragon Age is a very well made game, with a few minor bugs and glitches that would be expected in a release of this size. The combat system resembles a Baldur's Gate/NWN hybrid, but puts a simpler spin on the more complex DnD rules that were used by DA's aforementioned predecessors. This is not to say that combat doesn't require some micromanagement, because it does, and combat throughout is not meant to be rushed into mindlessly, guns blazing. This isn't God of War, it's an actual RPG, tactical thought will be required. Anyone turned off by that notion shouldn't be playing the game to begin with. Bioware does a great job in getting back to what made the genre itself so powerful with past titles, and created an RPG that is a ROLE playing game, not a ROLL playing game. This game features less min/maxing and damage meter watching, and focuses more on story and deep meaningful character development. Whether you like that or not depends on your own tastes as a gamer, but if the past is any indicator of success, the deep and ongoing story will be what truly continues to drive the franchise, beyond just this opening act. One thing that continued to surprise me during my time with this title was the codex, as simple a concept as it is, the depth of the lore and backstory is unparalleled in any recent undertaking, even by Bioware. Anyone who has played video games in the last decade has most likely heard of Bioware, and anyone familiar with their previous titles knows that dialogue will be a focal point of the game. Traditional multiple choice response interface follows, but the game does begin to make you feel as though your responses, as well as your actions will ultimately have an effect somewhere down the line in the story. This may not always be the case, but even the fact that this is a possibility makes the experience a much more conscious and relevant one. The game is not perfectly realized however, as level design does see a bit of staleness, and graphics feel very dated. These things do not detract from the experience as much as they would with smaller caliber titles however, and the scope of story and development still shine through the dull exterior colors. It would have been nice to see a bit more item variation within the game as well. Crafting becomes dependent on a very few important reagents, rather than having the more complex and powerful craftables require more work. There is too much in this game to go over at once, but these were just a few of the more relevant points of note. Overall, if you truly enjoy a story driven RPG, and you aren't put off by a lot of dialogue or combat micromanagement, this game is absolutely worth your time, and despite it's long playtime with all the side quests, will keep you coming back to get your money's worth for multiple plays through and future DLC and expansions. In a very thin and watered down gaming market, this was an actual bright spot, a shining beacon of hope for a genre that is being killed by the disposable MMO and the typical console gamer. One of the best new titles of 2009.\"]\n",

            "Dragon Age: Origins [\" Dragon Age is an amazing game. That is no doubt. The voice-work is top notch and the story is immersive and very well written. Every character you encounter, from the lowly guard to the players in your party, has a unique attitude. Interacting with these characters can be a challenge if you're trying to be the 'good guy' because a lot of the choices are unclear as to being right or wrong. Do you kill the child and slay the demon with it or do you sacrifice his mother to save the boy? To make matters more confusing are the extremely different perspectives of your party and how they think of you for doing certain things. Trying to balance a happy party is tough work but with a little help from gifts you acquire along the way, it is feesable to make most of your party pleased with you. Combat is challenging to say the least. Managing your partys actions in combat can be a chore at times. You have very limited combat tactics slots to start with and even as you gain more, you get more and more skills along the way to fill up those few slots. Leaving your team to do their own thing works for the most part using this system but to kill harder foes, you'll more than likely need to take control of them manually in order to access all of their abilities. And trust me, you'll need to use all of the tricks up their sleaves. The mosters of DA:O are no push overs. These aren't your run-of-the-mill RPG trash monsters you crush for XP and money; every battle counts. Even early on you'll find yourself running low on health potions and such. I recommend rolling a healer to start, honestly. I started off as a 2-handed sword swinging brute and later regretted it as combat became more and more difficult without a healer to back me up in the early parts of the game. I could go on for a while about DA:O but I won't delve too much deeper on a Metacritic review. Overall the game is fantastic. Rich lore, great story, exciting (and bloody) combat, amazing sound effects (the combat sounds real), a variety of armor and weapons, skills and items, and downloadable content already out with more to come, I'm sure, make this game definately worth the price tag and then some. $50 bucks for 100 hours of gameplay with numerous endings and extremely high replayability.

Voice acting is really well done, and party members bounce off one another superbly. There have been some lines that made me laugh out loud while playing. Keeping everybody happy is proving to be quite a challenge too, much more so than Mass Effect of KOTOR were. I welcome the challenge; it makes you really consider everything you do much more carefully. Speaking of which, I've been moaning for years the polarity of 'morality choices' in these games. I applauded the initiative to make choices matter, but found the execution lacking. Everything was always 'be good' or 'be evil', with no interesting choices. Bioware have really nailed it in this game. So far, at around 30 hours into the game, I've encountered situations where there is no good or bad choice; rather I've found myself confronted by agonising decisions where there are no right answers, and every choice could conceivably have disasterous outcomes for all involved. The major decisions in this game carry a lot of weight, and I'm really looking forward to seeing how they play out through the rest of the campaign.

            "Dragon Age: Origins [' There is a lot not to like about this game, but even more to like. I agree with much of what other reviewers have said regarding negatives, but I can\\'t stop playing this title. Onto the pros and cons: GRAPHICS: The graphics are good over all, but it\\' clear that they were designed for the overhead \"classic\" RPG view, because when you zoom into explore mode, the graphics look very old-school. Low quality textures even at the highest setting. The graphics don\\'t compare to say, Oblivion, but then again, this isn\\'t Oblivion. The artistry of the graphics is fantastic and the facial modeling is actually light years better than Oblivion; every person actually looks like a different individual as opposed to other games where it\\'s the 5 male and female faces every time. The towns and forests are well done and really suggest their environments well. In short, more polygons and higher quality textures are needed, but for what it is, it\\'s great and doesn\\'t detract from the fun. SOUND: Can\\'t say enough about it, the soundtrack is phenomenal. I\\'m glad to see such effort put into a game soundtrack. GAMEPLAY: Definitely different from older BioWare games. Most battles aren\\'t evenly matched in terms of numbers. It\\'s not uncommon to fight your four adventurers to say, 12 bandits or undead at a time. However, when in tight spaces, it\\'s easy to draw out enemies a few at a time into an ambush, but for the plot battles, it\\'s always in a giant room and four versus 15. So often it\\'s the old shtick of how-many-health-potions-can-you-use-to-get-through-a-battle. And these enemy numbers aren\\'t fodder. Enemy archers are absolutely lethal and rogues appear out of thin air and back stab, and the fighters always seem better equipped. Enemy mages are usually weak oddly enough. In fact, mundane bandit battles are much harder than major plot battles. The AI is fair at best. Enemies mindlessly target your mages, even when being battered by your fighters. Large groups of enemies are easily duped into ambushes, and won\\'t attack until you until you\\'re very close to them. Enemies have no fear and won\\'t attempt to flee, nor will they use health poultices. It\\'s clearly a leveled system, but there are always battles/enemies that are beyond the groups level which serve to conceal this fact (Revenants and High Dragons anyone?) The combat system is classic BioWare and well done. If you liked KotoR and NWN then you will like DAO. The tactics menu is a little to complex in my opinion. You can assign a behavior to an NPC for nearly any scenario imaginable. The skills and spells are well thought out and classes are very customizable with the specialization slots. Weapons and equipment are very well done. No longer do you pine for powerful magic weapons, because regular weapons are also capable due to the interesting variety of fantastical materials they can be made from (veridium, ironbark, etc.) and their crafter (dwarven, Elvish, etc.). Yes, it\\'s the same thing as magic weapons, but it\\'s nice to use a simple dwarven silverite sword instead of Unholy Blood Sword of Wrath a la Diablo. STORY: The story is very creative, although it mimics real politics and religion a bit too much. There\\'s a bit of a departure from the Tolkien standard of the races (dwarves, elves, humans) in the role of the elves, but I have to admit, it\\'s very interesting. The plot flows well and the game constantly reminds you of it in the mundane encounters. When you run into a battle while traveling, sometimes it will be a group of mercenaries sent by Loghain to hunt you, or darkspawn fighting an ally that you won over recently. The main quest is very well integrated into the game and is never \"forgotten\" as in Oblivion. CONCLUSION: A must-have title for a BioWare fan, but this may disappoint if you\\'re expecting a game like Oblivion or the Witcher. It\\'s old school and that\\'s what makes it great. In regards to the other reviewers gripes about unbalanced foes and poor party members, it\\'s simply a matter of using tactics. If you find that are losing battles a lot and getting overwhelmed, change your tactics. Use different party members. Use the tactics menu. A BioWare game means having to pause constantly during a battle and reevaluate tactics. And if you still are losing, then leave it be and wait until you advance. Many battles aren\\'t meant to be winnable under a certain level. All the plot battles are balanced though, even with large numbers. The game is meant to be playable straight through the main quest, but much of the challenge lies in the side quests.']\n",

Там действительно выбор что-то значит. Когда ты приходишь в Орзаммар, Дагна просит тебя помочь отправится ей обучаться в Круг, обычный, казалось бы, сторонний квест, но, когда ты встречаешь девушку в Скайхолде в DAI и она рассказывает, как десять лет назад Серый Страж осуществил ее мечту, на душе становится теплее. И из таких мелочей состоит вся серия DA. Например, если ты устроил тройничок с Алистером и Изабеллой, он стал королем и на встречу в DA2 ты берешь девушку, они не воздерживаются от комментарием о той ночи. Зачастую в игре нет выбора между плохим и хорошим, как пример, выбор короля Орзаммара.

            "Dragon Age: Origins [\"Dragon Age Origins is one out of three western RPGs that I've played that deserves a '10' rating in my book (the other ones are Witcher 3 and Neverwinter Nights).  I think it's the last great Bioware masterpiece that takes place in a fantasy setting.\\r\", ' ', \"This game is so interesting to me because it's a great example of how good game design and execution is more important than original ideas.  You can describe the story of this game in one sentence: Every x number of years, hero warriors called Grey Wardens are called to push back an incoming enemy invasion of evil beings called Darkspawn.  That's it.  It's laughable how simple and rehashed this story is.  But oh my God did Bioware absolutely NAIL about every other aspect of this game.\\r\", ' ', \"First off, the world-building was done so well.  In addition to how generic the plot is, many aspects of this fantasy world are too.  There are humans, elves, dwarves, sorcerers, etc... How many times have we seen this before?  But damn all of the various locations are so memorable and wonderful to explore.  I can't exactly articulate why this is so, but I think it has to do with how well designed and cohesive this high-fantasy world was designed.  It feels like a real, living, breathing place.  I played this game in 2018, about 9 years after it came out.  However, I was very impressed with the graphics and I feel they hold up really well.\\r\", ' ', \"The biggest strength of this game (in addition to the combat) is the character development.  I'd say the characters in this game are the best written characters in any western RPG I've played, and it's the reason why this game is so good despite the generic plot.  My party throughout the game was myself (male rogue), Morrigan, Alistair, and Sten.  We've seen the **** witch' archtype and taciturn giant before in games, but Morrigan and Sten were written and executed so well that they're the gold standard for these archtypes in my opinion.  Alistair was more unique and fantastic because he is so goofy and clumsy, yet sensitive and insecure.  I had an absolute ball getting to know and developing relationships with these characters.\\r\", ' ', \"I loved the combat system and found it to be so much fun.  Keep in mind I'm biased because I love 'real-time with pause' type of games such as Baldur's Gate 2 and Pillars of Eternity, but I felt Dragon Age Origins was the best executed real-time with pause system out of all of them.  I think this is because the game controls as well as any other real-time with pause game, but lets you zoom and in  out of the combat so you can see characters close up in addition to an isometric angle.  This makes it less boring than just seeing the isometric perspective that you get from a game like Baldur's Gate.\\r\", ' ', \"The controls were also top-notch, intuitive, and well done.  The interface of the game is kind of similar to Neverwinter Nights and all of your special skills can be assigned to the F1-F9 keys.  It's easy and simple to get your characters to do what you want them to do.  And the relationship system in which you gain relationship points with your companions is easy to understand and streamlined so well.\\r\", ' ', \"No game is without its flaws.  I honestly can't think of too many for Dragon Age Origins, but one pretty significant issue I had with the game is the difficulty.  I played it on 'normal' difficulty but damn was the game hard, especially towards the beginning.  This was partly due to me not figuring out how potions worked, but I almost was considering putting the game down towards the start because of the difficulty curve.  Bandit parties and enemy spellcasters were slaughtering my party with regularity towards the start.  And I'm somewhat of a veteran with real-time with pause games.  If it was this tough for me, it might be near impossible for a new player to handle.  I somehow made it through the start by taking a very slow and steady approach to the combat, but I think the difficulty was too harsh overall.\\r\", ' ', \"So with that all said, I'd fully stamp this game with the '10' rating as it really doesn't get much better than this when it comes to western RPGs!\"]\n",

After 15 minutes of playing, I started to find the game to be boring and repetitive. The whole process of waiting for those Sun orbs to come onto the field so you can collect them was beginning to irritate me. It was also slow and boring at times, seeing the same zombies marching forward and seeing your peeshooter plants just shooting slowly at the zombies became just too boring to continue playing. I dont understand why they couldn\\'t have an option to change the resolution, because on bigger screens the game looks stretched and of poor quality. In general, I thought the game was fun at first but it quickly became boring and dull.

This is a game that is more suited on newgrounds, or the DS or a PSP or even Xbox live or the PSN network, I just think it\\'s odd spending 2000 euro on a PC to play games that look ten years old, but yet they are modern games.

And for the other people calling themselves \"real Gamers\" or \"Hardcore Gamers\", again just stop it, it\\'s embarrasing. You don\\'t see people who like books or films describing themselves in such a manner. You are just using these terms because a) you are immature and you are trying to show others that you are mature by being a \"hardcore gamer\"; or b) or you are insecure and you are trying to create a masculine image out of something that has always been seen as childish and nerdy.

Even includes an own garden so you can plant and take care of your very own plants that you use in the middle of fights elsewere in the game! The Adventure mode is even playable not only once, you can do it again, in a little harder state so it isn't too easy because of all your recent plants and upgrades, and that gives a plus. The shop is also awesome, because you will grind money till you have every single thing in the shop bought.\"]\n",
