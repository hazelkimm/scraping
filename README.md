# scraping

This is to make a restaurant recommendation system based on Yelp reviews.

It's selecting keywords representing each store and makes a recommendation for the restaurants that have the same or similar keywords. Keywords extraction was implemented through the keyBERT technique, and similarity verification was processed through Word2Vec natural language processing.
